                    ,We offer virtual consultations via Zoom as well as phone consultations.  Our staff includes a team of Nurse Practitioners, RDs, health coaches, and physical therapists.  All of our NPs, health coaches, and RDs are working towards certification in Functional Medicine while being mentored by a certified Functional Medicine practitioner.  We work with a wide variety of patients; we see patients with complicated medical problems as well as professional athletes.  The amount of on-line support and offerings we offer our patients can not be overstated.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Our patients view our services as an extension of their current healthcare team.  Many patients prefer that we be the leader of their healthcare team.  However, we highly recommend that all patients have an established PCP.  Even though our services are offered solely on-line via virtual consultations, we are still able to provide high quality care and support.  Our patients appreciate the convenience, efficiency, and flexibility allowed by virtual visits  We spend a great deal of time with our patients.  Our patients are never without guidance and direction.  We provide comprehensive care plans after all visits.  Insurance may be used for labs but not our consultation services.  Many patients use a health savings account to pay for visits.,

At initial visits we may spend an extended period of time reviewing all aspects of their history in order to seek out the root causes to their health problems and to accurately create a treatment plan that will help them achieve optimum health.  ,

I am intellectually curious--sometimes patients need a detective, someone who will research options, including less conventional approaches.  My passion is to help people find and maintain health by helping the body function its best.  Sustainable Paths is a solo practice.  ,

                    ,Your first appointment will focus on history -- what has happened, when did you last feel well, how do you take care of yourself?  I also do a physical exam.  We then discuss treatment and testing options, and proceed from there.  First appointment is typically 1.5 hours.  Future appointments may be done by webinar, and are often 1 hour so that problem solving and education can be included.,

In order to find solutions that work for you, your role in this partnership includes (to the best of your ability/circumstance) includes:,
,
    Being honest about what you can or cannot do.,

2) To design a personalized health plan to reverse their condition or conditions.,
3) To arm them with enough knowledge and tools/health strategies so they do not become dependent on me, once I’ve achieved their health goals. This means a patient will understand how to sustain their health by knowing what to eat and not to eat, what’s the best vitamins/minerals/herbals for them to take. Also, how to read and understand their blood work, how to deal with everyday stressors, and what’s the best exercise program for them, and more.,

                    ,Hi, my name Anup Kanodia.  I am a conventionally trained Mayo Clinic Medical Doctor with three years of additional training in functional and integrative medicine both at Harvard University and with Dr. Mark Hyman. I am a board-certified family medicine and functional medicine.,
 The people who come to KanodiaMD have a wide range of needs. Some have medical symptoms that cannot be explained after visiting multiple healthcare providers. Others have health issues that can be treated through medications or lifestyle changes, and they choose to make the changes and avoid the medications. In all cases, we ask questions you have never been asked before and go down avenues with you that have not been explored.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We combine the best of conventional medicine with a functional medicine approach to lifestyle, nutrition, detoxing and stress reduction. The lab testing we offer is specialized, and any supplementation is targeted. ,
,
Throughout our time working together, my mission is always clear:  find the root cause, identify it, treat it and eliminate it.  This process is key to helping you transform your health and empower you to live the joyful, vibrant life you were meant to live. ,
,
We look forward to working with you.,

                    ,My practice is a psychiatric/mental health practice focusing on nutrition as one of the primary interventions in helping individuals achieve better mental health.  As a registered dietitian and psychiatric nurse practitioner certifie in functional medicine- I am uniquely qualified to address and treat the underlying causes of depression, anxiety, and mood dysregulation by identifying nutrient imbalances, gut dysfunction, and triggers of inflammation.  Though I do prescribe medications, I more often emphasize non-pharmacologic interventions when treating mood and thought disorders. These can include an elimination diet, supplements, referrals to therapy, exercise programs, and mindfulness practice.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,The practice offers a unique treatment approach for individuals seeking to improve their mental health.  Because we believe that patients should be empowered to manage their health and be active participants in their care- we offer our services as an all-inclusive personalized nutrition and lifestyle program.  Using a functional medicine approach to heal takes time, takes knowledge, and requires commitment. We work with our patients collaboratively and provide  education, consistent support, and access to the practice's clinicians.

                    ,Returning to or optimizing health is aided by being understood in your individuality, including genetic, physiologic, emotional, mind & spirit and how you fit into your social world. Working in partnership with you and from the precepts of both functional medicine and anthroposophical medicine on a solid basis of allopathic medicine I work to develop a deep understanding of the individual and partner with her to reach healthy goals.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,New patients are asked to complete an extensive online history before their first appointment.  Bringing previous test results is appreciated and helpful.  The intake appointment is rather extensive and you can expect to spend 2+ hours at the office where we will dig into your story and problems in a comprehensive way, including spending time with my coach Carol McCarthy.  Generally you will leave with recommendations on several levels, perhaps be asked to do further testing and then give feedback at a future date so we can modify your plan as needed.,

Patients have access to their own health information, including lab results, comprehensive personalized assessment plan, and educational handouts via the patient portal 24.7.  After each Functional Medicine visit, patients receive an updated plan which ensures that both doctor and patient are always on the same page.  The portal also provides an avenue for patients to ask questions directly to their doctor in between visits, should the need arise,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,

                    ,I'm Dr. Christine Maren, a functional medicine physician, real food enthusiast & mother of two dedicated to helping others restore good health so that they can lead the life they deserve. I'm board-certified by the American Board of Family Medicine and trained by the Institute for Functional Medicine (IFMCP) & Amy Myers M.D. I opened my own practice in 2017 after working at Austin UltraHealth in Austin, Texas. I have since relocated to the Metro Detroit area and am now booking in-person and telemedicine appointments in beautiful Michigan. I continue to see established patients via telemedicine and am thrilled to now offer new patients in Michigan, Texas and Colorado the option to establish care remotely through telehealth.,

                    ,During an initial consultation, I will spend 60-90 minutes with you reviewing current health concerns and discussing personal and family history in detail. I order comprehensive lab studies through ""conventional labs"" like Quest or LabCorp, as well as specialized functional laboratory testing through Doctor's Data, Great Plains, Genova, DUTCH, CYREX and others. We typically schedule a follow up 2 weeks after the initial visit to review lab results and make more specific recommendations in terms of medications, supplements and diet. Another follow up is scheduled 6 weeks from the initial visit to review functional medicine labs and make adjustments to your plan. You will receive a detailed, actionable plan after every visit.,

                    ,Dr. Bump has been practicing Functional Medicine for over 30 years, and is currently teaching physicians how to apply this mode of healthcare in their practice.  His intention is to guide each patient along a very personalized path to a balanced healthy state, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. We use state of the art diagnostic tools when establishing a patient's very individualized treatment plan and counsel patients in all aspects of healing. This includes dietary, lifestyle and stress management with a certified lifestyle educator. Dr. Bump is now offering Skype consultations world wide.

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients can expect to spend a couple of hours with Dr Bump during their first office visit. He believes that if he is to help someone along their health journey, then he should take the time to get to know them and to learn their story. Very often the conditions and concerns patients present with are established in patterns of behavior, microbial infections, organ weakness etc, that may have started years before symptoms began. Patients should expect to meet a doctor who cares about who they are as individuals and will, with years of skillful experience, assist them along their journey to wellness.,

                    ,Arispe Wellness Center, PLC (name changing soon to Compass Center Functional Medicine, PLC) strives to identify and manage the root causes of various health conditions as well as offer suggestions for symptom relief.  This practice does not accept insurance, but provides documentation with ICD-10 codes which patients may submit to insurance for possible reimbursement.  Medicare and Medicaid patients unfortunately cannot get reimbursed for visits.  Classes are being developed to provide education on various topics at a lower cost.  Tests not typically covered by insurance may also be available in the classroom setting.  ,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I integrate conventional medical practice with functional medicine principles and alternative practices.  I do perform osteopathic manipulation and FSM in my practice if needed.  My goal is to improve overall wellness and if possible reduce medications and improve lifestyle choices.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I am transitioning from Adventist Health to a Bloom Functional Medicine micro practice clinic in Gladstone January 2018.  Until January, I will not be able to take calls, schedule appointments or answer questions.  I will not be taking primary care patients.  After initial visit to establish care, some follow up visits will be available as telemedicine visits. ,
