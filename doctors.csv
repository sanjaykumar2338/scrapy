Our clinical model is based on individualized care that is customized to fit each patient?s particular condition. We do not simply treat symptoms. Instead, we work to determine the root cause of symptoms and then to reverse the disease process by supporting the unique physiological make-up of each, individual patient. This allows the body?s own innate healing ability to take control. Only then, can optimal wellness can be achieved.","Dr. Jason J. Koenig, D.C., Founder and Clinical Director, utilizes a holistic, whole-person approach to treatment. This approach to wellness means looking for underlying causes of any disturbance or disruption, which may or may not be causing symptoms at the time, and then working to return the body to normal function. As a result, Dr. Koenig is able to help patients accelerate or maintain their journey to complete wellness. Dr. Koenig promotes a multidisciplinary approach to health care. He practices as a collaborative provider with traditional medical care, rather than an alternative to it.

She uses nutrition, exercise, mind-body, physical therapy modalities, and chiropractic manipulation to treat her patients. ","A big part of Functional Medicine is exploring your personal and family history in detail. You can expect to do a lot of talking in your first appointment. I will ask you about your exercise and diet, and I may also ask about your mental well being, spiritual health, and social factors. Considering these areas helps me see your health in the context of you as a whole person, not just in terms of your physical symptoms. The treatment plan we design together will likely include changes in your lifestyle: what you eat, your physical activity, how you deal with stress, your exposure to potentially toxic substances, and other factors. ,

Once a diagnosis is made, a specific treatment plan comprised of traditional and alternative medical interventions is initiated.","My mission is to offer thoughtful, thorough  evaluation and treatment of medical problems.  Patients can expect my full attention and care.  I am interested in offering a comprehensive plan, emphasizing nutrition, movement, and restorative sleep, but also addressing mind, body and spiritual wellness.  I am certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and the Institute of Functional Medicine, and I believe in the Integrative model of care delivery.  In other words, I blend evidence based diagnostic evaluation and therapies from allopathic, and Functional Medicine sources.  I believe that both types of medicine have a lot to offer.

As an Internal Medicine and Functional Medicine Physician I help people navigate their medical care using functional medicine approaches as a foundation.  As an IST practitioner I help people see and connect to who they are beyond mental and physical challenges and emotions.  Using nutrition response testing helps address nutritional deficiencies.","Please contact me at info@drjuliareznik.com to set up a free 15-minute phone consultation.

This is not a practice for a patient who is looking for a pill for every ill. Instead, expect to look inside and find what aspects of your lifestyle, your beliefs or home environment need to be changed.  Sometimes, this might be clear from the history and physical exam. At other times, we will use one or a combination of advanced functional lab testing,  meditation based mental and emotional sourcing and Nutritional Response testing techniques to find our answers.  Every person is unique, and as such each approach is individualized. ,

I view health as an ecosystem, looking at how a patient is functioning as a whole - not as pieces or parts.  Functional Medicine gave me effective tools to both evaluate and treat in this way.  I was proud to be in the first graduating class of the Institute for Functional Medicine's rigorous certification program in 2013.   I apply Functional Medicine in the evaluation and balancing of personal genomic and lifestyle influences on health.   It allows me to be a ""medical detective"" in search of the root causes of symptoms and conditions. I now treat women and men.","You should expect a warm welcome and to be treated with kindness and respect.  We are a fairly small office and patients find it relaxing and comfortable.  There will be a lot of paperwork in advance so that we can understand you better at the first visit.   My consultations with patients are lengthy and the exams are comprehensive.  We work with a variety of labs including many functional medicine labs.  We also do some testing on-site .   Evaluations are typically in areas of your health, background and lifestyle that are new and exciting to most patients.

Treatment using Osteopathy in the Cranial Field involves a gentle hands-on approach to free the areas of the body in which motion has become restricted.  The hands on evaluation and treatment is the perfect compliment to Functional Medicine by giving  critical information on the progress of interventions and by augmenting our body's ability to return to health. ","Initial visits can last up to one hour and follow-up visits up to 30 minutes. After a thorough history is obtained, the patient receives an Osteopathic structural and functional examination. A detailed history including a Functional Medicine Timeline and other intake forms, and a physical and Osteopathic evaluation and treatment occurs in the first visit. With complicated issues, treatment approaches and lab investigation may not all occur on the initial visit, but will be decided over the course of  several visits due to the fact that this practice has an insurance model which only allows for a certain amount of time for each visit.",,"Allergies,Arthritis,Asthma,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autoimmune Disease,Cardiovascular disorders,Chronic Disease,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Chronic Pain,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Diabetes,Digestive disorders,Fatigue,Female Disorders,Fibromyalgia,Gluten Sensitivity,Hypertension,Infections (acute and chronic low-grade such as Lyme, Candidiasis etc.),Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Male disorders,Mercury and Heavy Metal Toxicity,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Migraines and Headaches,Multiple Sclerosis,Neurodegenerative disorders,Skin Disorders,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns",English,University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine,"IFM, ILADS, American Osteopathic Association, American Academy of Osteopathy, Cranial Academy, Maine Osteopathic Association"

That generally entails a detailed conversation about your current state of health, health history, family history, diet, lifestyle habits, etc. At that point, we will discuss with you potential approaches and recommended laboratory workups. This visit will last approximately 75 minutes and is primarily an information gathering and sharing session. We may make some recommendations at this time, but most advice will be deferred until after lab and physical exam results are in and there has been time to thoughtfully consider your case.","Acupuncture,Allergy and Immunology,Alternative Medicine,Anesthesiology,Botanical Medicine,Cardiology,Chiropractic,Critical Care Medicine,Dermatology,Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism,Family Medicine,Functional Medicine,Gastroenterology,General Practice,Geriatric Medicine,Health Coaching,Hematology,Hospice and Palliative Medicine,Infectious Disease,Internal Medicine,Lifestyle Medicine,Medical Toxicology,Naturopathic Medicine,Neurology,Nutrition,Occupational Medicine,Oncology,Orthopaedic Medicine,Pain Medicine,Public Health and General Preventive Medicine,Sports Medicine","Aging,Allergies,Arthritis,Asthma,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autoimmune Disease,Cancer,Cardiovascular disorders,Chronic Disease,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Chronic Pain,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Diabetes,Digestive disorders,Eating Disorders,Fatigue,Female Disorders,Fibromyalgia,Gluten Sensitivity,Hypertension,Infections (acute and chronic low-grade such as Lyme, Candidiasis etc.),Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Male disorders,Mercury and Heavy Metal Toxicity,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Migraines and Headaches,Multiple Sclerosis,Neurodegenerative disorders,Skin Disorders,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns",,"DO, DC, MS, MBA, FAARM, D Herb FICT, FACACN, ABAARM, IFMCP, ART, DCN: Fellowship in Integrative Cancer Therapeutics; FMNM: Fellowship in Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine","American Society of Hypertension, Institute of Functional Medicine, Metabolic Medicine Institute, A4M, American Osteopathic Association."

I do not see Functional Medicine patients in person.  I do not serve as a primary care physician for patients.  I serve as a Functional Medicine consultant.  I most often give you a plan that you can work through with your in-person doctor.  It helps to make Functional Medicine more affordable and accessible for patients all over the world.",I practice Functional Medicine primarily through Telemedicine.   I meet with patients in person as required legally.

? Nutritional Psychiatry","Although the body can compensate for many injuries and insults, there are several factors causing inflammation and/or imbalances in metabolism that, over time, give rise to symptoms and what most people cause diseases.  I help patients find and correct these factors by going to the root cause of their symptoms rather than the overuse of medications.  My patients find that by addressing their lifestyle, nutrition, stress, environment, and genetic susceptibilities, they can regain control of their health and their happiness.  Many are even able to reduce or eliminate their medications once the other factors are improved.  Call me today to find out how I can best help you!","Functional Medicine,Psychiatry","Aging,Arthritis,Autoimmune Disease,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Diabetes,Digestive disorders,Fatigue,Fibromyalgia,Gluten Sensitivity,Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Male disorders,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Multiple Sclerosis,Neurodegenerative disorders,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns","English,Spanish","Ponce School of Medicine, NYU School of Medicine","IFM, APA, ISSWSH, AASECT, SSTAR, ISSM"

They will be supported by a team of professionals in addition to their physician, and may be offered a variety of therapies, including nutrition counseling and coaching, personal training, acupuncture, botanical and conventional medicines, nutritional supplements, energy medicine, acupuncture, massage, hypnosis and acupuncture.

Without proper digestion, absorption, and gut microbiota balance, systemic disease will arise in various forms. By treating the root cause(s) of disease, we can help you to restore balance to your system and alleviate symptoms of disease while restoring health as a whole.","We require all patients to complete a thorough, online questionnaire to explore your family history, personal history, and current symptoms. Once potential patients complete the questionnaire, we will review your answers and determine if we are a good fit for your health concerns. Not all patients will be accepted, especially if we deem that your health issues are outside of our scope of practice.,
,
Because our work focuses on digestive health as one of the major underlying contributors to health concerns, patients can expect to make major changes in diet. We often ask our patients to eliminate certain inflammatory foods or food groups for periods of time. As this can be difficult, we offer health coaching to assist with lifestyle changes.","Functional Medicine,Health Coaching,Lifestyle Medicine,Nutrition","Autoimmune Disease,Cardiovascular disorders,Diabetes,Digestive disorders,Gluten Sensitivity,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns",English,The University of Virginia School of Medicine,"NCSF-National Council on Strength & Fitness, IFM-The Institute for Functional Medicine"

We believe that this is accomplished through forming a  partnership, patient with physician,  always keeping the patient's goals in mind, to restore health and balance.  We understand that every patient is a unique individual and they have an active roll in reaching their health goals..","All new patients fill out an extensive history on the patient portal prior to the first visit.  This helps us to use our time more efficiently at the initial visit.  The first visit takes from 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  This is essential to understanding the patient's history and factors which contribute to the present situation.  At the end of this visit, the patient will be given a personalized functional prescription, which includes a dietary and lifestyle prescription, possibly supplements or medications, and laboratory testing as indicated.  A follow up visit may be scheduled to assess progress and follow up with laboratory testing.  We also offer health coaching to help support patients in making lifestyle changes to reach their health goals.","Anesthesiology,Functional Medicine","Gluten Sensitivity,Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Mercury and Heavy Metal Toxicity,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Migraines and Headaches,Skin Disorders,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders",English,"Emory University School of Medicine-Anesthesiology, Institute For Functional Medicine-Functional Medicine Practitioner Certification","Institute for Functional Medicine, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Georgia Society of Anesthesiologists"

Dr. Ducat's treatment philosophy is founded on a systems approach to biology, which views the body/mind as a network of differentiated yet linked physiological and psychological processes. One can neither understand nor treat an illness, mental or physical, without taking into account the entire web of relationships -- psychodynamic, biochemical, genetic, social, and environmental -- from which all symptoms emerge. Dr. Ducat sees patients in Bend, OR and online.","Patients can expect Dr. Ducat to treat them as respected collaborators in their care, listen to their story, gather a comprehensive history, order lab tests that can yield actionable findings, and then assemble all this data into a treatment plan based on causes, rather than diagnostic labels.","Functional Medicine,Naturopathic Medicine,Neurology,Psychiatry","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Autoimmune Disease,Chronic Disease,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders",,"National College of Natural Medicine, The Wright Institute, Psychoanalytic Institute of Northern California, Institute for Functional Medicine","National Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Psychiatric Association of Naturopathic Physicians, California Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Naturopathic Academy of Environmental Medicine, International Psychoanalytic Association."

From the assessment I assist clients in developing a Nutrition and Lifestyle Action Plan.

","Each person presents to the clinic with his or her own diet, lifestyle, psychosocial issues, environmental factors and genetic influences. At 3rd Opinion we try to understand these unique variables at a deep level. For us the question is not “What disease do you have?” but rather “Why would you have that disease?” These are very different questions and they lead to very different opportunities. As an example, if you carry a diagnosis of arthritis, the treatment is anti-arthritis medicine. If you ask the question “Why do you have arthritis?” it may lead to a fundamental understanding of your unique biochemistry.,

As a physician, I bring to our partnership the skills and training I received through Western medicine training in surgery and family medicine paired with certification through the Institute for Functional Medicine to utilize a whole body, systems-based approach in a mind-body-spriit paradigm to find and address the root causes of disease. I prefer to help you heal your body with modification of diet and lifestyle rather than treat any disease with a drug or supplement.,
,
Our relationship as partners, each with important work, is foundational to your success. My practice is small, personal, and patient-centered.","My goal is to be a physician-partner to my patients. We spend approximately 90 minutes to 3 hours together at your initial consultation forging our partnership and identifying your health goals and challenges. You receive a custom plan after your visit that addresses food, movement, lifestyle modifications, supplement recommendations, medications, and suggested labs. Patients then decide if they would like to pursue the proposed treatment plan and join me as patient-partner.,

Full descriptions of each appointment and the overall experience you can expect with my practice can be found on the website.

This is a family medicine solo micro practice, meaning that I provide all the services offered in my one room office. I have no staff which allows me to take care of a smaller number of patients and focus as much time as is needed with each of you. Your phone calls and e-mails will often be answeredI prefer to rely more on healthy lifestyle and less on pharmaceuticals. My interests are strong in nutrition and in “food as medicine,” and as a result I am pursing certification in Functional Medicine. This will blend nicely as I enjoy collaborating with a wide array of traditional medical specialists and alternative holistic providers to provide patients with great healthcare. Time with patients is what I value the most. ","I opened my solo micro Family Medicine practice to be able to offer slow medicine. What do I mean by ""slow""? Both as an employed physician and as a patient, I have experienced mainstream medicine to resemble an assembly line form of care. Patients who are motivated to understand why they have a medical problem, rather than just wanting a pill to solve the problem, often need longer appointments than typical 10-20 minute visits. Longer visits which can be up to 60 minutes or longer, allow more holistic healing and future health success.

•	Personalized- understanding that genetic and environmental variations drive individual treatments,
•	Predictive- using tailored health strategies based upon a personalized map of health risks using both traditional and novel biomarkers,
•	Preventive- using proactive vs. reactive approaches which shifts the focus from illness to wellness, and from disease treatment to functional enhancement,
•	Participatory- it empowers and engages the patient, with the physician as guide, coach, and facilitator – a collaborative relationship vs. an authoritative one",,,,,"AOA, ACOFP, AAO, DO-Touch.net, IFM"

I provide personalized medication evaluation and management services, and psychotherapy. I strive to address barriers in our healthcare system that I have time and again observed to have frustrated individuals’ attainment of their truest and healthiest potentials. These include time, cost, logistical challenges; approaching mental health from reductionist perspectives; and failing to identify and address root causes of distressing signs and symptoms. In my efforts to address mental health issues from a whole-person perspective, I have trained, and continue to train in the expanding field of functional medicine.","My patients must expect to be fully participative in their care. Getting well often takes hard work! Treatment begins with a thorough diagnostic process that could spread over several weeks and appointments. Diagnostic interviews are supplemented by self-administered questionnaires and instruments, chart reviews from all previous medical and psychiatric encounters, referrals to and collaborations with primary and specialty care, and lab and genetic testing. The involvement of your chosen support team in this process is strongly encouraged. As a clearer picture emerges from this process, you will be presented with treatment options and my recommendations.

,
Using a functional medicine-based framework to uncover root causes of disease, we build with our patients a biochemically and psychosocially-driven analysis for understanding the whole-person health history throughout the life course. This framework includes gathering clues from your past and your present. These clues are systematically organized into antecedents, triggers, and mediators that converge to influence your current health state. ","We regard our relationship with our patients as a collaboration. We help you understand the root causes of your disease and empower you to actively take back control of your health. This is done through therapeutic strategies that may include food as medicine, acupuncture, stress-management techniques, supplements, detoxification program, adjustment or reduction of prescription medications, and other integrative modalities such as qigong and mindfulness practice. We teach you the skills to help you recover from disease and create a sustainable path to health and wellbeing.","Acupuncture,Functional Medicine,Geriatric Medicine","Aging,Allergies,Arthritis,Asthma,Autoimmune Disease,Cancer,Cardiovascular disorders,Chronic Disease,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Chronic Pain,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Diabetes,Digestive disorders,Fatigue,Fibromyalgia,Gluten Sensitivity,Hypertension,Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Mercury and Heavy Metal Toxicity,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Migraines and Headaches,Multiple Sclerosis,Neurodegenerative disorders,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns","Chinese,English","Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Geriatric Medicine, Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School; Internal Medicine, Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School; Doctor of Medicine, SUNY Downstate College of Medicine","American College of Physicians, American Geriatrics Society, Institute for Functional Medicine, Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine"

I feel the healing is incomplete when either one is left out.  Having practiced Mind-Body Medicine for 5 years I have seen that there are metaphysical reasons for our dis-ease(s). I have seen rashes to chronic pain to open wounds heal spontaneously through the use of Mind-Body Medicine techniques.  When we work at the emotional level we catch the dis-ease at the root cause.   Physical illness is just a symptom of an energy blockage and once the emotion is release the physical symptoms resolve.  Feel free to read my blog if you wish to learn more about the process at https://lotushealinggardens.com/blog/. ,"Patients can expect to feel better if they are ready and willing to follow the recommendations and are willing to do their inner work.  There is no ""magic pill"" but rather guidance that will lead you far.  The key to your health is how much you are willing to implement the principles in your life.  You cannot heal by thinking the same thoughts that created your dis-ease to begin with.  I will guide you in rising above your thoughts so you can re-claim your health at all levels: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.  This process will help to expand your consciousness and will help to awaken you as that is where our true healing lies... In our awakening.

All initial appointments must be in-person; follow-up appointments may be via telephone.  ","It is important to understand that chronic diseases take time to heal.  While I do have some patients who are ""cured"" after one appointment, this is not the usual case.  I am interested in addressing all of your concerns but it is necessary for you to be a partner in your path to healing.  This may require dietary and other lifestyle changes.  It may also include initial and follow-up labs (which insurance may or may not cover, depending on your insurance plan).  I am willing to work with you at your own pace.

Dr. Wei is a board-certified Ob/Gyn with 17 years of experience in conventional women's medical care. After pursuing extensive training in functional and integrative medicine, she now offers a unique opportunity to discover true health and vitality through restoring the natural rhythms and balance of your body. Restoring the body's balance will alleviate the symptoms of the common concerns many women face: fatigue, GI problems, depression and anxiety, difficulty maintaining an ideal weight, and female hormone balance issues such as menstrual cycle irregularities, fibroids, endometriosis, PMS, PCOS, fertility, perimenopause, and menopause.","Dr. Wei provides consultative functional medicine services only. Although she continues to be board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology, she has chosen to devote her time fully to functional medical care. She does require that you have ongoing regular care with your gynecologic care provider and with your primary care provider. If you do not have a gynecologic care provider, Dr. Wei is happy to provide references to providers who support a holistic approach to women's health.","Functional Medicine,Lifestyle Medicine,Nutrition,Obstetrics and Gynecology","Aging,Autoimmune Disease,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Digestive disorders,Fatigue,Female Disorders,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns",English,University of Virginia School of Medicine,"Institute for Functional Medicine, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology"

It is you who does the work.So in my mind?I don?t heal people. They heal themselves.And if I've done my job right, then you?ll be feeling better and have a much better idea of what your body?s unique needs are and how to meet them. Why?

Your monthly cost is your age (minimum of $25, maximum of $75).  The practice is a low-stress environment where patients can come to get answers and help with many medical issues, be they new or chronic. Longer visits are the norm (commonly 90 minutes or longer), and you may contact me after hours via phone or email.  I enjoy finding and fixing root causes of chronic diseases, with a  strong emphasis on prevention, collaboration and patient education. Questions / inquiries welcome, and initial consults are no-obligation.","Patients should expect to be treated with respect and dignity. I do not pretend to know everything there is to be known in either conventional or functional medicine, but I am intellectually curious and enjoy learning and teaching my patients about what is going on in their bodies. Although I am very open-minded and flexible in most regards, I am nonetheless quite cautious about prescribing most controlled substances as I believe they generally do more harm than good. I do operate a separate Suboxone clinic for those struggling with opiate addiction, but do not otherwise prescribe chronic opiate pain medications for non-cancer pain.

I use very gentle chiropractic adjusting with a method called Directional Non Force Technique. I began DNFT in 1989. In addition to DNFT, I use functional medicine to lead people to optimum health via maximizing their sleep hygiene, enhancing their healthful movement (exercise), eating in ways that support their goals of performing their best and feeling their best mood. I was a chemistry major before I went to chiropractic college. Functional medicine's review of the biochemical pathways that affect your ability to perform, ability to feel contented and deal with complex chronic situations as compared to your personal genome is the part of the picture that brings the toughest cases improvement.","Unconditional positive regard is what you can expect from our visit together. I will make many suggestions, knowing that it can be overwhelming to make many changes at once. YOU will pick which, if any of the suggestions you are now ready to undertake. You will set the pace for the recovery. We'll talk about transforming stress. We'll talk about sleeping your best. We'll talk about  moving your  body enough to stimulate mood and immunity, without wearing you out. We will analyze your genes with 23 and Me to see which genetic propensities you have to need more vitamins, minerals and enzymes.

Over time, I have developed an interest in optimizing health in women. While the traditional medical model has made great strides in acute care, it is lacking success in treating chronic issues that many women deal with on a daily basis. This has led me to Functional Medicine, and using a systems biology approach to look for the root cause of these conditions to truly maximize an individual's potential for wellness.","A patient who is choosing a Functional Medicine approach to health needs to be ready to did deeper into the conditions that are currently being expressed, and be ready to take a collaborative approach to wellness.

An important part of this work is to also address the physical health issues that may result from long-standing stress and trauma. I use a combination of modalities as part of a functional approach to optimizing health (homeopathy, nutrition and dietary supplements, herbal medicine and mind-body medicine) and welcome anyone seeking greater health and consciousness.,

","My top priority is to give my patients the time and attention they deserve. I created my practice to help patients who are frustrated with mainstream healthcare that treats the body and mind like separate, disconnected parts.

When your time together is complete, you will have a treatment plan that is specifically for you.,
,
When you leave, we want you to feel better than you did when you arrived and know that you made the right choice. Above all, we want you to leave with hope that your health and your life can be better.,

Functional Medicine focuses on understanding and addressing the fundamental physiological processes, the environmental inputs, and the genetic predispositions that influence health and disease - so that interventions are focused on treating the cause of the problem, not just masking the symptoms. We are wide in scope, and address issues involving gut, thyroid, adrenal, hormones (including BHRT), methylation, aging, energy and much more. ","To be able to better serve you, we need to understand your personal situation (and not put you into a preconceived ""box"" based on checklists or pre-made protocols). Thus, our initial visit is almost 2 hr, including direct MD consultation (90min) and Health Coach consultation (15-20min). ,
,
PRIOR to your initial visit, we request completion of targeted questionnaires. ,
,
We work together to develop a plan action customized for you. You will receive a VERY extensive written ""Encounter Note"" outlining findings and the plan of action for each visit. You also receive multiple PDFs with appropriate information based your individual needs, as well as an overview Care Plan note. ,

Finally, each visit includes InBody evaluation at no charge.

 ,
Most days, you can find me hanging out in my mid-century modern-inspired home office. I’m a comfy-pants-wearing functional medicine maven who loves nerding out on herbal remedies… healing foods… and all things hormone-related.,
That’s right, I run my virtual practice from home, and I must say that it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I get to sip on oolong tea (or butter coffee) and help women reconnect with their body, their mind, and their purpose. My goal is to help guide them towards becoming their best self – radiant, fulfilled, and focused.,
 ,
Through helping women reclaim their health, I’m also challenging the current medical paradigm. One where YOU’RE in charge.","One of my goals when working with you is to flip the “scrip” on your idea of wellness. You’re here because you believe that you can feel better – and I agree with you 100%! BUT I’m going to give it to you straight – you’re going to have to do some work. The good news is that Corrine and I will be here to support and guide you the whole way. Remember, an estimated 80% of your success is based on YOUR actions – I’m not here to give you a magic pill to fix you. You can fix yourself, and I’ll teach you how! I call this Health-Empowerment. You’ll gain a wealth of knowledge that will benefit you and your family for a lifetime.",,,,Bastyr University,"The Institute for Functional Medicine, American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Washington Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians"

Chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and other viral infections, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) are my favorites for this reason. Hashimoto's and autoimmunity have special places in my heart, too; helping my mom manage her Hashimoto's and Rheumatoid Arthritis was what got me into functional medicine, as well as discovering my own autoimmunity.,

If you're sick and tired of being sick and tired let's get started! You have a world of potential just waiting to be tapped into ASAP.,

More about my story:,
http://www.infinityholistichealth.com/meet-the-doctor","Each practitioner has their own way of practicing functional medicine; no two of us are alike. I place less emphasis on lab testing than my functional medicine colleagues- I can usually gather the information I need with inexpensive labs, a physical exam, and a good pair of ears.,
,
I would rather see you use your money on healthy food and herbs instead of testing, where possible. I order tests (blood, urine) through Labcorp or Quest on everybody, usually through your health insurance. If either of us decides that we want more information than what that can provide, we always have that option.,
,
I like to think of myself as a sherpa guiding you on your health journey. I don't have all the answers, but I will help you find them in time.","Botanical Medicine,Chiropractic,Functional Medicine,Lifestyle Medicine,Nutrition","Autoimmune Disease,Cancer,Chronic Disease,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Digestive disorders,Fatigue,Female Disorders,Gluten Sensitivity,Infections (acute and chronic low-grade such as Lyme, Candidiasis etc.),Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Migraines and Headaches,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders",English,"Southern California University of Health Sciences, 2012","North Carolina Integrative Medicine Society, Institute for Functional Medicine"

","Functional Medicine requires getting to know the patient as a whole person, including your current symptoms and why you are seeking a consultation, but also your family history and how you got to the place you are today. This will require intake forms which are quite detailed to be filled out, and a treatment plan will be created which will likely focus on diet, exercise, sleep, stress and other lifestyle modifications. We will work together to devise the plan, and I will help throughout your journey to get you to the place you want to be.",,,,BS Pharmacy (Albany College of Pharmacy),"IFM, Functional Medicine Pharmacists Alliance"

I now dedicate my practice fully to Functional Medicine Consultations and am passionate about getting to the root cause of symptoms and dis-ease. I work in partnership with each patient and use the best available testing to help us identify areas that need support. I develop an individualized treatment plan for each patient to help them heal while we watch their symptoms improve and often disappear.  My extensive Internal Medicine experience allows me to integrate the best of both worlds.","My initial consultation lasts between 60-90 minutes. A very detailed and complete past medical, surgical, social, family and nutritional history is obtained. An initial impression and treatment plan is developed and testing is ordered. The testing is quite comprehensive and usually involves blood, stool, urine and often saliva samples. The first and second follow up visits are scheduled for 2 and 6 weeks later.

We start with lifestyle -- nutrition, movement, sleep and stress.  Before a patient's first visit, they will complete an extensive questionnaire that gathers information about health history, family history, diet, habits and symptoms. At the first 60 minute visit, we review this questionnaire in detail and determine appropriate lab testing.

Does stress at your job or in your relationship cause you to overeat? Does lack of sleep or low energy prevent you from exercising? As we work together, we will look at how all parts of your life affect your health as a whole. My approach with nutrition is not to dwell on calories, carbs, fats, and proteins but to address your bio-individuality; which is the idea that each of us has unique food and lifestyle needs. One person?s food is another person?s poison, and that?s why fad diets tend to fail in the long run.

In this type of treatment, our providers establish a partnership with our patients to achieve their health goals. We spend time discussing personal and medical histories, as well as lifestyle and environmental factors in order to determine the cause of the conditions and diseases our patients experience.",Our goal is to empower our patients with the education and tools necessary to help them live life free from the burden of disease. ,,,,,

I hope to complete my Functional Medicine (through IFM) and Herbal Medicine (through David Winston) programs in Fall 2018. I have started offering a few interested clients functional/holisitic/herbal health consultations as I finish my training. I also work in a local Urgent Care practice as a Nurse Practitioner and occasionally do massage at the Spa of Colonial Williamsburg.  ",Please feel free to make an appointment for massage or myofasical services through the scheduling page on my website. If you are interested in a functional/holisitic/herbal health consultation please email me. With these clients I apply all the threads of my background and what I am currently learning. Some clients have agreed to let me confidentially document our collaborative healthcare journey for case studies I need in my programs. This may be a good option for persons without insurance or other options for holistic care. Both online and in person consultations are possible. ,"Alternative Medicine,Botanical Medicine,General Practice,Health Coaching,Sports Medicine",,English,PhD in Medical Anthropology from Columbia University; MS in Nursing from Virginia Commonwealth University,"AANP, IFM, "

She is thrilled to share her medical and acupuncture expertise with the people of eastern Iowa and improving the lives of the people we serve.","We offer a free 15 minute consult to see if functional medicine and/or medical acupuncture is right for you.  Your first scheduled visit usually lasts about an hour in which Dr. Teggatz takes a very detailed history and performs a physical exam.  Based on these findings and any previous medical records provided, lab testing is usually ordered.  The second visit involves going over these tests and making a detailed treatment plan which usually involves diet, movement, improving sleep and relationships, stress management and the use of supplements and occasionally medications.  Dr. Teggatz also works closely with a health coach who  provides further instruction, accountability and inspiration.  Acupuncture is an optional, beneficial service.","Family Medicine,Functional Medicine","Aging,Allergies,Arthritis,Asthma,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Autoimmune Disease,Cardiovascular disorders,Chronic Disease,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Chronic Pain,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Diabetes,Digestive disorders,Eating Disorders,Fatigue,Female Disorders,Fibromyalgia,Gluten Sensitivity,Hypertension,Infections (acute and chronic low-grade such as Lyme, Candidiasis etc.),Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Male disorders,Mercury and Heavy Metal Toxicity,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Migraines and Headaches,Multiple Sclerosis,Neurodegenerative disorders,Skin Disorders,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns",English,Roy G.

I became increasingly frustrated with my inability to make significant improvements in a patient's health.  I was treating their symptoms, but unable to see a real change in their outcomes.  I began to use all my resources to gain knowledge about what  the underlying causes of their symptoms and disease could be.  In doing this I began to see how stress, environment, nutrition, activity level and lifestyle choices were things I could change and as a result see change in labs and ultimately outcomes.  I chose to make Functional Medicine the focus of my practice.  My practice focuses on the patient and all that relates to the patient.","Patients should expect to be treated as a whole person.  They can expect to get an education about their health and life that will enable them to make changes to improve longevity.  I run extensive lab panels to determine not only your current level of inflammation, stress and disease, but also predict future disease risk.  Together, we will come up with a comprehensive plan to improve you health and happiness.","Family Medicine,Functional Medicine","Aging,Allergies,Arthritis,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Autoimmune Disease,Cardiovascular disorders,Chronic Disease,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Chronic Pain,Depression, Anxiety or Bipolar Disorder,Diabetes,Digestive disorders,Fatigue,Female Disorders,Fibromyalgia,Gluten Sensitivity,Hypertension,Infections (acute and chronic low-grade such as Lyme, Candidiasis etc.),Insomnia and Sleep Disorders,Male disorders,Metabolic Syndrome (pre-diabetes, insulin resistance),Migraines and Headaches,Multiple Sclerosis,Neurodegenerative disorders,Skin Disorders,Stress-related Conditions,Thyroid, adrenal and other hormonal disorders,Weight or Metabolism concerns",English,"UMDNJ, Rutgers","A4M, IFM, AAPA"

 I have found, since beginning to practice healthcare in 2004, that the most effective way to heal & maintain wellness is to address all aspects of self- body, mind, & spirit. I offer Functional Medicine & Shamanic Healing to support healing from the inside out.  Together we put on our detective hats and unravel the clues to your health. We start by taking ample time to discuss your history.  Many answers are right there. Next we discuss testing & then treatment options- which are holistic & may include: diet, lifestyle, mindfulness, movement, supplements & Rx's. We continue working together until the healing is complete.  ","I welcome you to be fully engaged in your healing & wellness, & I will do the same. The first appointment together is 1 hour so that I fully get to know you, & understand the causes and effects of what has contributed to your current state of health. Follow up appointments are 30-60 minutes, depending on your unique care.  Treatment plans are highly individualized & may involve bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, or bi-annual appointments. My goal is to develop a plan together that is sustainable, measurable, effective, well tolerated, & fully supported by you. I accept United Healthcare Commercial & Tricare, & Rocky Mountain insurance. Most clients are private/cash pay & may use HSA/FSA. Long distance is an option, depending on the needs.

It comes from within, which means you'll need to be actively engaged in the process and willing to make changes in your life in order to see changes in your health. Most of my patients are highly motivated to do what it takes to feel better, they just need some guidance on their path to wellness. I'd be honored if you chose me to help guide you, too.",,,,,
