                    ,We offer virtual consultations via Zoom as well as phone consultations.  Our staff includes a team of Nurse Practitioners, RDs, health coaches, and physical therapists.  All of our NPs, health coaches, and RDs are working towards certification in Functional Medicine while being mentored by a certified Functional Medicine practitioner.  We work with a wide variety of patients; we see patients with complicated medical problems as well as professional athletes.  The amount of on-line support and offerings we offer our patients can not be overstated.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Our patients view our services as an extension of their current healthcare team.  Many patients prefer that we be the leader of their healthcare team.  However, we highly recommend that all patients have an established PCP.  Even though our services are offered solely on-line via virtual consultations, we are still able to provide high quality care and support.  Our patients appreciate the convenience, efficiency, and flexibility allowed by virtual visits  We spend a great deal of time with our patients.  Our patients are never without guidance and direction.  We provide comprehensive care plans after all visits.  Insurance may be used for labs but not our consultation services.  Many patients use a health savings account to pay for visits.,

                    , I have a passion for helping my patients achieve optimum health by taking time to look for the cause of their symptoms. I focus on lifestyle medicine and use my previous degree in Nutrition to help guide treatment plans.

                    ,I will expect that my patients are an active participant in their healing and in creating their treatment regimen. My patients should expect that I will constantly be referring back to the choices they make in their life and how that affects their overall health. At initial visits we may spend an extended period of time reviewing all aspects of their history in order to seek out the root causes to their health problems and to accurately create a treatment plan that will help them achieve optimum health.  ,

                    ,My journey to functional medicine is rooted in my family.   I am intellectually curious--sometimes patients need a detective, someone who will research options, including less conventional approaches.  My passion is to help people find and maintain health by helping the body function its best.  Sustainable Paths is a solo practice.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Your first appointment will focus on history -- what has happened, when did you last feel well, how do you take care of yourself?  I also do a physical exam.  We then discuss treatment and testing options, and proceed from there.  First appointment is typically 1.5 hours.  Future appointments may be done by webinar, and are often 1 hour so that problem solving and education can be included.,
,
In order to find solutions that work for you, your role in this partnership includes (to the best of your ability/circumstance) includes:,
,
    Being honest about what you can or cannot do.,
    Listening to your body and tell me what is happening.,
    Finding clean food, water, environment.,
    Being active.,
    Nurturing healthy relationships.,

,
I have three goals for my patients. ,
,
1) To find the root cause or causes of their health issue. ,
2) To design a personalized health plan to reverse their condition or conditions.,
3) To arm them with enough knowledge and tools/health strategies so they do not become dependent on me, once I’ve achieved their health goals. This means a patient will understand how to sustain their health by knowing what to eat and not to eat, what’s the best vitamins/minerals/herbals for them to take. Also, how to read and understand their blood work, how to deal with everyday stressors, and what’s the best exercise program for them, and more.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Hi, my name Anup Kanodia.  I am a conventionally trained Mayo Clinic Medical Doctor with three years of additional training in functional and integrative medicine both at Harvard University and with Dr. Mark Hyman. I am a board-certified family medicine and functional medicine.,
 The people who come to KanodiaMD have a wide range of needs. Some have medical symptoms that cannot be explained after visiting multiple healthcare providers. Others have health issues that can be treated through medications or lifestyle changes, and they choose to make the changes and avoid the medications. In all cases, we ask questions you have never been asked before and go down avenues with you that have not been explored.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We combine the best of conventional medicine with a functional medicine approach to lifestyle, nutrition, detoxing and stress reduction. The lab testing we offer is specialized, and any supplementation is targeted. ,
,
Throughout our time working together, my mission is always clear:  find the root cause, identify it, treat it and eliminate it.  This process is key to helping you transform your health and empower you to live the joyful, vibrant life you were meant to live. ,
,
We look forward to working with you.,

                    ,My practice is a psychiatric/mental health practice focusing on nutrition as one of the primary interventions in helping individuals achieve better mental health.  As a registered dietitian and psychiatric nurse practitioner certifie in functional medicine- I am uniquely qualified to address and treat the underlying causes of depression, anxiety, and mood dysregulation by identifying nutrient imbalances, gut dysfunction, and triggers of inflammation.  Though I do prescribe medications, I more often emphasize non-pharmacologic interventions when treating mood and thought disorders. These can include an elimination diet, supplements, referrals to therapy, exercise programs, and mindfulness practice.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,The practice offers a unique treatment approach for individuals seeking to improve their mental health.  Because we believe that patients should be empowered to manage their health and be active participants in their care- we offer our services as an all-inclusive personalized nutrition and lifestyle program.  Using a functional medicine approach to heal takes time, takes knowledge, and requires commitment. We work with our patients collaboratively and provide  education, consistent support, and access to the practice's clinicians.

                    ,Returning to or optimizing health is aided by being understood in your individuality, including genetic, physiologic, emotional, mind & spirit and how you fit into your social world. Working in partnership with you and from the precepts of both functional medicine and anthroposophical medicine on a solid basis of allopathic medicine I work to develop a deep understanding of the individual and partner with her to reach healthy goals.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,New patients are asked to complete an extensive online history before their first appointment.  Bringing previous test results is appreciated and helpful.  The intake appointment is rather extensive and you can expect to spend 2+ hours at the office where we will dig into your story and problems in a comprehensive way, including spending time with my coach Carol McCarthy.  Generally you will leave with recommendations on several levels, perhaps be asked to do further testing and then give feedback at a future date so we can modify your plan as needed.,

                    ,At Arizona Wellness, we provide the highest quality, personalized, evidence based Functional Medicine in the state of Arizona, with a concierge style team approach.  Patients have access to their own health information, including lab results, comprehensive personalized assessment plan, and educational handouts via the patient portal 24.7.  After each Functional Medicine visit, patients receive an updated plan which ensures that both doctor and patient are always on the same page.  The portal also provides an avenue for patients to ask questions directly to their doctor in between visits, should the need arise,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Our mission is to create a partnership that helps every patient reach their personal best health.  We seek to accomplish this with passion, compassion, and education, as well as quality time spent getting to know the entire health portfolio of each patient.  Our goal is to guide patients in their own journey in achieving optimal health by addressing the whole person, not just a set of symptoms.  Functional Medicine finds and treats root causes of disease using evidence based science and innovative tools to deliver personalized, high quality, modern healthcare.,

                    ,I'm Dr. Christine Maren, a functional medicine physician, real food enthusiast & mother of two dedicated to helping others restore good health so that they can lead the life they deserve. I'm board-certified by the American Board of Family Medicine and trained by the Institute for Functional Medicine (IFMCP) & Amy Myers M.D. I opened my own practice in 2017 after working at Austin UltraHealth in Austin, Texas. I have since relocated to the Metro Detroit area and am now booking in-person and telemedicine appointments in beautiful Michigan. I continue to see established patients via telemedicine and am thrilled to now offer new patients in Michigan, Texas and Colorado the option to establish care remotely through telehealth.,

                    ,During an initial consultation, I will spend 60-90 minutes with you reviewing current health concerns and discussing personal and family history in detail. I order comprehensive lab studies through ""conventional labs"" like Quest or LabCorp, as well as specialized functional laboratory testing through Doctor's Data, Great Plains, Genova, DUTCH, CYREX and others. We typically schedule a follow up 2 weeks after the initial visit to review lab results and make more specific recommendations in terms of medications, supplements and diet. Another follow up is scheduled 6 weeks from the initial visit to review functional medicine labs and make adjustments to your plan. You will receive a detailed, actionable plan after every visit.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Dr. Bump has been practicing Functional Medicine for over 30 years, and is currently teaching physicians how to apply this mode of healthcare in their practice.  His intention is to guide each patient along a very personalized path to a balanced healthy state, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. We use state of the art diagnostic tools when establishing a patient's very individualized treatment plan and counsel patients in all aspects of healing. This includes dietary, lifestyle and stress management with a certified lifestyle educator. Dr. Bump is now offering Skype consultations world wide. Please visit his web site to learn more. www.drbump.com,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients can expect to spend a couple of hours with Dr Bump during their first office visit. He believes that if he is to help someone along their health journey, then he should take the time to get to know them and to learn their story. Very often the conditions and concerns patients present with are established in patterns of behavior, microbial infections, organ weakness etc, that may have started years before symptoms began. Patients should expect to meet a doctor who cares about who they are as individuals and will, with years of skillful experience, assist them along their journey to wellness.,

                    ,Arispe Wellness Center, PLC (name changing soon to Compass Center Functional Medicine, PLC) strives to identify and manage the root causes of various health conditions as well as offer suggestions for symptom relief.  This practice does not accept insurance, but provides documentation with ICD-10 codes which patients may submit to insurance for possible reimbursement.  Medicare and Medicaid patients unfortunately cannot get reimbursed for visits.  Classes are being developed to provide education on various topics at a lower cost.  Tests not typically covered by insurance may also be available in the classroom setting.  ,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I integrate conventional medical practice with functional medicine principles and alternative practices.  I do perform osteopathic manipulation and FSM in my practice if needed.  My goal is to improve overall wellness and if possible reduce medications and improve lifestyle choices.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I am transitioning from Adventist Health to a Bloom Functional Medicine micro practice clinic in Gladstone January 2018.  Until January, I will not be able to take calls, schedule appointments or answer questions.  I will not be taking primary care patients.  After initial visit to establish care, some follow up visits will be available as telemedicine visits. ,

                    , I have a solo practice for adults that is individualized to the patient's unique needs.  I use a combination of conventional (allopathic) medicine integrated with ""alternative"" methods.  I use Functional Medicine extensively.,
,
My special interest is health issues that have not been resolved using mainstream medicine e.g. fibromyalgia, fatigue, chronic pain, toxicity, tick borne illnesses, hormonal imbalances.,

                    ,At the Squirrel Hill Family Wellness Center we have a passion for helping individuals with  complex medical conditions break free from the confines of the conventional paradigm where illness is simply managed and instead bring a sharp focus on optimizing each individual's unique underlying environmental, genetic and physiologic imbalances which lie at the root cause of chronic disease.  We work very closely with our patients to  develop individualized wellness protocols that will optimize diets, eliminate toxins, improve tolerance to stress, revitalize the microbiome, reverse key nutrient deficiencies, eradicate infectious entities, promote sleep and cultivate better lifestyle choices so that our patients may achieve optimal wellness.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Our initial 90 min appointment entails an extensive review of our 22 page health questionnaire and previous testing/results  prior to the actual visit which provides for a very focused discussion of the most pertinent needs for each client  at the office.  An initial protocol will then be provided with a focus on lifestyle interventions, diet and key testing .  During the initial 1hr follow-up  a thorough review of all testing will be performed and a more detailed wellness regimen will be crafted.  While we do not accept insurance directly for visits we utilize for testing whenever possible and provide superbills to submit for reimbursement .  We take pride on close relationships with our patients and are available at all times to help!,

I take time to listen and consider the whole person with his or her own uniqueness.   I implement individually tailored testing and treatments to restore health and well-being. I use a  patient centered interdisciplinary approach considering an individual?s mind, body and spirit to create a partnership.  Lifestyle, exercise, dietary, hormonal, nutritional and herbal supplement recommendations are given in the context of a medical and nutritional background. Referrals to other practitioners from various other disciplines are made when appropriate.This is all done in a warm, friendly and relaxed environment to enh,

                    ,Generally, the first visit lasts between an hour and an hour and a half. During the initial visit, the majority of the time is focused on gathering a thorough history and discussing the patient?s reason and goals for seeking treatment.  In the later part of the visit, depending on time and the complexity of the issues, the treatment approach is discussed and various options for further testing and lifestyle modifications are reviewed.  No blood work is performed on site.  Follow-up visits last between a half hour and forty-five minutes and are spent reviewing health concerns, reviewing test results and fine tuning treatment plans and lifestyle modifications.The goal in treatment is to use natural means whenever possible and medications on,

                    ,As a hands-on medical clinician trained to restore health and function, my educational background is in three seperate discipline's: functional medicine, physical rehabilitation, and nutrition/sports nutrition. In my practice, I provide patient consultations whereby I develop personalized, evidence based, health and wellness programs which target the root cause(s) of a patient's symptoms. I work with specialty labs to uncover genetic risk factors, hormone imbalances,  micronutrient deficiencies, food sensitivities, advanced lipid testing, heavy metal testing, gut/micro-biome imbalances,  detoxification strategies, and BIA testing. For details and insurance limitations, please see the Services, Contact, and FAQ's areas of my website.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,At Philadelphia Personal Health you can expect to enter into a partnership with an experienced medical practitioner. A big part of Functional Medicine is exploring your personal and family history in detail so I can begin to understand your unique state of health. You will be ask to register in a secure patient portal and complete a thorough health history prior to your initial appointment. That detailed history helps me see your health in the context of you as a whole person, not just in terms of your physical symptoms. The treatment plan we design together will likely include changes in your lifestyle: what you eat, your physical activity, how you deal with stress, your exposure to potentially toxic substances, and other factors.  ,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,We have a full scoop functional medicine practice teaming up with a functional nutrition consultant/health coach for weight loss, optimal nutritional health and support for a variety of nutritional and life style recommendations to prevent or reverse chronic disease.   We have done extensive training with Dr. Dale Bredesen with his protocol to prevent or reverse cognitive decline, which includes knowledge to treat biotoxin (mold) illness.  We also have a division of sexual health to improve or resolve sexual dysfunction.  We also feature the MonaLisa Touch fractionated laser for non-hormonal treatment of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,A partnership between provider and patient quickly develops during the first visit of 60 minutes or more as we delve into minute, but important aspects of their lives.  We start at birth and include a time line of events which adds valuable insight into onset of chronic disease or symptoms.  The evaluation can include traditional blood work, comprehensive expanded panels to assess cardiometabolic, GI, neurotransmitter, biotoxin,hormonal/adrenal/thyroid functioning and sexual health. Also, an advanced GI work-up is almost always included due to the significant interplay of gut health to immune, brain and overall wellness.  Subsequent visits are 30-45 minutes with a provider, including regular nutritional/health coaching support when needed. ,

                    ,Cancer is a multi-dimensional disease. To manage cancer, one must think like cancer. ,
,
I specialize in adjunctive cancer care, and I see patients battling all stages of cancer and going through all stages of treatment. I am very passionate about educating patients on cancer risk and relapse prevention. My goal is to increase patient's quality of life and overall disease free survival.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Since cancer can be thought of as a metabolic, genomic, and even hormonal issue, patients may expect me to look at each system and tailor a personalized treatment plan for their cancer that is compatible with concurrent chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy. ,
,
Adjunctive cancer care is designed to support the patient in the following ways:,
- minimize side effects experienced from chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy,
- strengthen immune surveillance,
- preserve function,
- target tumor growth by looking at tumor type,
- educate patient's friends and family on cancer,
- reduce stress and anxiety,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,This practice is for young people of any age motivated to achieve optimal health, determined to put into remission their chronic condition. We combine functional medicine approach with conventional medicine utilizing advanced testing, functional nutrition, targeted nutritional supplementation and lifestyle coaching. We are particularly interested in gastrointestinal disorders, thyroid and other auto-immune conditions, women's health, dementia prevention. We offer whole body detoxification, IV glutathione, bio-identical hormones, ReCode Bredesen protocol, whole array of functional testing to find and address the root cause of your problem. Our biggest joy is to watch patients (who were not helped by multiple doctors) getting better.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Dr. Konrad accepts ONLY new patients with commercial Harvard Pilgrim, Tufts, BCBS insurances (patients with other insurances will be directed to other functional medicine doctors in our office who accept direct pay). The insurances pay for 25-40 min (out of 60-90 min) visits. Extended time is billed to insurance but is usually rejected and it is the responsibility of the patient ($160/30 min). We offer also group visits that are NOT billed for extended time. We are NOT primary care providers. For patients with HMO insurances, a referral from PCP is required. If you do not have PCP, we will help you to find one. Telephone appointments are $160/30 min (not covered by insurance). Many functional tests are PARTIALLY covered by the insurance. ,

                    ,I look for the root cause of chronic conditions by assessing  nutrition, lifestyle, environmental exposures, stress and genetic factors that can be modified or reversed to restore optimum health.  I see people with a wide range of symptoms and conditions and work with each one to develop a personalized plan for evaluation and treatment.  Many of my clients have autoimmune conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, psoriasis, inflammatory arthritis and lupus, SIBO, and digestive issues.  I am a long time practitioner of meditation and bring this perspective to the work I do.  At Blum Center for Health we have a functional medicine nutritionist and other integrative medical specialists who can also contribute their expertise when needed.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Personalized care that includes standard and functional medicine testing, an emphasis on food as medicine, and ways to make step by step changes to achieve healing and optimal health.  We offer cooking classes and meditation classes as additional ways to support our clients' health and well being.,

                    ,Each day I meet with patients that are at their wits' end trying to find the cause of their chronic medical condition(s). Based on my medical training, along with my background in radiology, and my deep understanding of how blood tests are created and conducted, I strive to find answers to medical conditions that have gone undiagnosed and untreated. Once conditions are accurately diagnosed, I then create an effective customized treatment plan that addresses the root of the medical condition. ,
,
I believe that Functional Medicine is, without a doubt, the future of medicine – and I am passionate about sharing my medical teachings and practices of this life changing medicine with my patients.,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,The first thing you can expect, is that I will listen – carefully. We’ll discuss your medical history, your lifestyle and your symptoms. You can count on me not to dismiss your feelings, your observations, or how your chronic medical condition is preventing you from leading the life you deserve. I will combine my medical training and knowledge, along with state-of-the-art lab testing and scientifically proven methods to accurately diagnose and treat your condition. Treatment will include  a customized nutritional and lifestyle guide, along with supplements and – if needed – medication. I won’t stop until I get to the root of your condition, so that together we can help you become well and on the road to a happier and healthier life.,

                    ,We have created a practice out of a desire to solve patients' problems, rather than treat and mask symptoms. We combine the best of internal medicine and functional medicine. Our diagnostic methods and treatments are based on sound basic and clinical sciences. We rely on the latest from peer reviewed journals as well as clinical experience. Our target patient is someone who wants to engage, who wants to be taught how they can heal themselves. We are looking for patients willing to partner us for their healing and health maintenance.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Expect the best, and by that we mean, expect professionalism: courtesy from our staff, respect from our providers, and an explanation of the tests we do, why we do them, what the results mean, and how the results can be used to change your health for the better. We realize we cannot solve all medical problems. However, we make a solemn promise to our patients: if you do what we tell you, we take the responsibility for making you better. ,
,
Our services are comprehensive and time consuming. You will NOT get from any one specialist what you get from a functional medicine evaluation. Expect to pay a little more for our functional medicine services, even if you have insurance. If you make a regular appointment, don't expect functional medicine.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Dr. Eric Osansky has a practice that focuses on thyroid and autoimmune thyroid conditions.  He was able to restore his own health after being diagnosed with the autoimmune thyroid condition Graves' Disease.  His goal is to detect and then remove the underlying cause the problem, which in many cases will restore the function of the thyroid gland, improve the health of the gut and immune system, and address other affected areas of the body (i.e. adrenals, sex hormones, etc.).,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,The initial consultation will involve exploring your health history in detail. Although my focus is helping people with thyroid and autoimmune thyroid conditions, there will be other questions I ask which might not seem related to your condition, but will be important to help assist in finding the underlying cause of your condition, determine what additional testing you may need, etc.  During the first consultation I will also give certain dietary and supplement recommendations.  Prior to the initial consultation please be prepared to complete some patient intake forms, including a health history, metabolic assessment, and toxin exposure questionnaire.,

                    ,I am Functional Medicine Nutritionist. Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner and Lifestyle Transformation Specialist who is passionate about educating, guiding, coaching and assisting clients in finding balance in their life. Most recently, I had the unique opportunity of working for several years with Dr. Mark Hyman and his medical team at the UltraWellness center in Lenox, Massachusetts. Working with hundreds of diverse patients at this premier functional medicine center offered me a wealth of experience and knowledge.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,The practice of functional nutrition puts an emphasis on food choices.  However, when diet alone is addressed, it compartmentalizes our wholeness, limiting it's effects. Our bodies' imbalances can be linked to not only our diet but many other factors including our lifestyle, medical history, belief systems and our emotions. When we expand our view to include the full spectrum of our being we discover both wisdom and important information to guide us to wholeness. My approach includes a complete analysis of diet and lifestyle along with step by step program of practical ways to transform your health.,

                    ,  Many with complex chronic diseases can be restored to better health.Some can even loose their diagnosis completely. The imbalances that cause the diagnosis are more important than the diagnosis itself.  The goal is to correct the imbalances by discovering the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the person and what the body, mind, and spirit must have removed  to  establish optimum health.  Many methods are used to get the best results including various lifestyle modifications,diets, supplements, pharmaceuticals, IV oxidative treatments, IV detox treatments, energy  medicine,  epigenetics, and prayer. Treatment plans are individualized to accomplish the best outcomes for each patient and I am personally present  at each visit.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,You can expect to be asked about all factors that can affect your health, including relationships, what you eat and how you exercise, relax and sleep. You will be asked to complete comprehensive forms regarding your illness and how has occurred over time. I do a thorough physical exam on every new patient.  Time is given for questions at each visit while also welcomed by e mail or telephone call. All blood draws  and IV treatments are done in the office by seasoned professional personnel. However, testing can be done outside the office. I do not accept insurance but can provide information for individual filed claims. You can  always expect to be treated with compassion and respect.,

                    ,Patient should expect results within 30 days but this is also dependent on the severity of their case.

I view all conditions and treatment approaches through the 7 Stage to Health and Transformation Model.  Please visit www.hoffmancentre.com for a comprehensive overview of my approach.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,My clinic utilizes a comprehensive approach to maximizing an individual's true health potential. We offer 1-2 hour first visit appointments to discuss and review a comprehensive questionnaire. Antecedents, mediators and triggers of illness are elicited. This is followed by a physical exam and extensive functional medicine lab testing. Biofeedback stress and heart rate variability assessments and QEEGs are often done. Once the tests are completed, a 1- 2 hour treatment session is undertaken and a hierarchy of treatment interventions initiated. Follow-up appointments are undertaken every 1- 3 months. Follow up lab tests are reviewed and treatment protocols adjusted accordingly.,

                    ,Integrative Health Center of Alabama (IHCAL) is a functional medicine practice in Birmingham, Alabama that focuses solely on helping patients reverse chronic diseases including type II diabetes, thyroid issues, and autoimmune conditions. Our clinical model is based on individualized care that is customized to fit each patient?s particular condition. We do not simply treat symptoms. Instead, we work to determine the root cause of symptoms and then to reverse the disease process by supporting the unique physiological make-up of each, individual patient. This allows the body?s own innate healing ability to take control. Only then, can optimal wellness can be achieved.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Dr. Jason J. Koenig, D.C., Founder and Clinical Director, utilizes a holistic, whole-person approach to treatment. This approach to wellness means looking for underlying causes of any disturbance or disruption, which may or may not be causing symptoms at the time, and then working to return the body to normal function. As a result, Dr. Koenig is able to help patients accelerate or maintain their journey to complete wellness. Dr. Koenig promotes a multidisciplinary approach to health care. He practices as a collaborative provider with traditional medical care, rather than an alternative to it. Dr. Koenig works to communicate treatment plans and treatment rationale to the entire health care team of the patient including family members.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,HEIGHTENED HEALTH is a Direct Primary Care Functional Family Medicine practice. We employ a personalized, patient-centered, whole-person approach to healthcare, rather than a conventional, one-size-fits-all, disease-oriented focus.  Whether you are currently healthy and want a partner in maintaining good health or you are suffering with chronic disease and want to achieve your best possible health, we foster a proactive, vested partnership between patient and physician.,
,
Through this vested partnership, we strive to help heal, educate, and empower our patients.  By supporting every patient’s personal potential for optimal physical, mental, and emotional health, we seek to promote and restore wellness throughout one's lifetime.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,“The patient experience here will be different,” says Dr. Caccopola. “I have made a conscious effort to design my practice to be what the doctor-patient relationship should be: a partnership.”  In order to deliver on the promise of a patient-centered, personalized care, Heightened Health is a Direct Primary Care practice, meaning it is direct-to-consumer medicine.  Insurance is not accepted and the practice does not attempt to seek reimbursement for services provided.  Instead, it offers membership options in the form of different Wellness Programs, rather than the traditional fee-for-service model. This structure enables Dr. Caccopola to offer longer appointments, same-day or next-day sick visits, and little to no wait times. ,

I focus on your long-term wellness and fitness, not just the absence of disease.   ,

I can choose from a variety of cutting-edge labs and innovative diagnostic tools to scientifically determine your body's current status.  I also offer advanced ancillary services, such as Frequency Specific Micro-current, that can accelerate healing.  Your body was designed to heal & repair itself. My goal is to educate and empower you so that you can take charge of your health, and achieve LASTING optimal wellness rather than reactively respond to every crisis or condition.  Together we'll develop your own personal road map to success!,

                    ,Jessica Seaton, DC offers a functional medicine approach to personalize the treatment of chronic problems, such as fatigue, blood sugar issues, and joint pain. She uses nutrition, exercise, mind-body, physical therapy modalities, and chiropractic manipulation to treat her patients. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,A big part of Functional Medicine is exploring your personal and family history in detail. You can expect to do a lot of talking in your first appointment. I will ask you about your exercise and diet, and I may also ask about your mental well being, spiritual health, and social factors. Considering these areas helps me see your health in the context of you as a whole person, not just in terms of your physical symptoms. The treatment plan we design together will likely include changes in your lifestyle: what you eat, your physical activity, how you deal with stress, your exposure to potentially toxic substances, and other factors. ,
,
Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes filling out your pre-appointment. ,

                    ,The Functional Medicine Internist acts as medical detective, utilizing history, physical exam, and laboratory testing to arrive at the underlying or ""root"" cause of an illness.  Once a diagnosis is made, a specific treatment plan comprised of traditional and alternative medical interventions is initiated.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,My mission is to offer thoughtful, thorough  evaluation and treatment of medical problems.  Patients can expect my full attention and care.  I am interested in offering a comprehensive plan, emphasizing nutrition, movement, and restorative sleep, but also addressing mind, body and spiritual wellness.  I am certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and the Institute of Functional Medicine, and I believe in the Integrative model of care delivery.  In other words, I blend evidence based diagnostic evaluation and therapies from allopathic, and Functional Medicine sources.  I believe that both types of medicine have a lot to offer.  My goal is to restore patients to optimal health so  they can become the best version of themselves.,

                    ,I will work together with you, as a team, to look for the causes of your health concerns, to restore your health and to help you stay healthy! I believe that every little detail you provide about your symptoms can give us big clues to the underlying cause(s) of your dis-ease. I am here to listen, to help solve your unique puzzle and to help connect you to your bigger, joyful and vibrant Self.  ,
,
As an Internal Medicine and Functional Medicine Physician I help people navigate their medical care using functional medicine approaches as a foundation.  As an IST practitioner I help people see and connect to who they are beyond mental and physical challenges and emotions.  Using nutrition response testing helps address nutritional deficiencies.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Please contact me at info@drjuliareznik.com to set up a free 15-minute phone consultation.  You will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire to help us determine if my practice is a good fit for you.  ,
,
This is not a practice for a patient who is looking for a pill for every ill. Instead, expect to look inside and find what aspects of your lifestyle, your beliefs or home environment need to be changed.  Sometimes, this might be clear from the history and physical exam. At other times, we will use one or a combination of advanced functional lab testing,  meditation based mental and emotional sourcing and Nutritional Response testing techniques to find our answers.  Every person is unique, and as such each approach is individualized. ,

                    ,Minnesota Natural Medicine is a place where you can discover and apply the tools of functional medicine and pursue a comprehensive approach to solving health care issues. I work in a consultative medical office that provides a patient centered approach to health, aging, and disease.  We attempt to understand patient uniqueness through a comprehensive history, and look at interactions between genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors as a foundation to influence long-term health or address chronic disease.  My focus is on women's functional health, creating a partnership with my patients to help them achieve their optimal health and vitality.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Initial consultations are 90 minutes in length.  We spend this time mostly discussing personal and family history, reviewing lifestyle factors (nutrition, exercise, stress, sleep), and outlining goals.  Taking the time to fill out the female intake questionnaire and collect past pertinent testing is appreciated.  I also recommend bringing any medications, hormones, or supplements to the visit.   Pertinent objective information is collected through targeted physical and laboratory examination based on the patient's needs and goals.  Follow up consultations (frequency and length) are based on each patient's specific needs. Treatment plans are always individualized and no ""routine lab panel"" or routine schedule is followed.    ,

                    ,The Sandy Hook Clinic (SHC) is located in the Sandy Hook Village section of Newtown, Connecticut. The clinic is housed on the fourth floor of a rehabilitated old brick mill building, overlooking the Pootatuck River. Visitors find the clinic setting to be beautiful, centering and relaxing. Indeed, perched up above the river nestled in the Rocky Glen State Park, it feels a bit like being in a tree house.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I work within a University Integrative Health Center. I work to discover root cause analysis of disease. I am a board certified pediatrician but I also see a limited number of adult patients. I am currently only seeing patients up to age 25 years. I am licensed in the state of Pennsylvania that allows me to see patients via telemedicine in certain circumstances. I have a Masters in Functional/Human Nutrition from the University of Bridgeport, one of the best Universities that confers this degree. I work very closely with a functional nutritionist with all of my patients to develop personalized food plans for optimal health. I investigate biochemical abnormalities through conventional and functional laboratory testing. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I am very heart-centric, compassionate and caring. I have had my own personal journey of disease and ill health that has made me even more understanding about the challenges that often come with chronic illness. I prefer patients that are truly committed to the time and energy that it takes to get well again. Health and well being doesn't happen overnight.,
I am honored and humbled by the opportunity to walk patients through this amazing process.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I practice full-spectrum Functional Medicine for people suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia. I practiced Psychiatry for over 2 decades before learning Functional Medicine starting in 2009, as part of my own healing path to recover from serious autoimmune disease and Dementia. ,
,
I am trained in the Bredesen Dementia Protocol, and collaborate with Dr. Bredesen on clinical trials for people suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment and early Dementia. ,
,
At this time, I am restricting my practice to Mild Cognitive Impairment/Dementia/Neurodegenerative Disorders, and prospective patients can request a consultation or more information by visiting our website at www.BayAreaWellness.net ,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Functional Medicine is a partnership between the Functional Medicine provider and the patient. I serve as the detective and guide (as well as the cheerleader/support person), while it is up to the patient to make the targeted diet and lifestyle changes to achieve their health and wellness goals. ,
,
A Functional Medicine approach to Dementia and Cognitive Impairment requires a very motivated patient and the support of family and/or friends. Our goal is to both halt the dementing illness, and to re-wire the brain for restoration of cognitive function. ,
,
It takes a lot of work and effort, especially in the beginning months. but the rewards are immeasurable when we see people's brain function come back!!,

I also offer intravenous vitamin therapy, including NAD, to select patients for specific conditions and general wellness. I am board-certified in pediatrics and accept pediatric patients on a case-by-case basis.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,My medical training in primary care and women's health along with my former career as an environmentalist have given me a unique vantage point in my consultations with patients.  I view health as an ecosystem, looking at how a patient is functioning as a whole - not as pieces or parts.  Functional Medicine gave me effective tools to both evaluate and treat in this way.  I was proud to be in the first graduating class of the Institute for Functional Medicine's rigorous certification program in 2013.   I apply Functional Medicine in the evaluation and balancing of personal genomic and lifestyle influences on health.   It allows me to be a ""medical detective"" in search of the root causes of symptoms and conditions. I now treat women and men.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,You should expect a warm welcome and to be treated with kindness and respect.  We are a fairly small office and patients find it relaxing and comfortable.  There will be a lot of paperwork in advance so that we can understand you better at the first visit.   My consultations with patients are lengthy and the exams are comprehensive.  We work with a variety of labs including many functional medicine labs.  We also do some testing on-site .   Evaluations are typically in areas of your health, background and lifestyle that are new and exciting to most patients.   We often hear  ""Finally, someone is able and willing to help me find answers!""   Treatments are aimed at replacing what's missing and re-balancing the whole.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,The physicians of Osteopathic Healthcare of Maine are dedicated to applying the principles of Osteopathy in the care of our patients. We are all board certified in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine and our practice is primarily devoted to consultations for this type of care.  We use the full range of Osteopathic modalities, with an emphasis on Cranial Osteopathy and Biodynamics. Treatment using Osteopathy in the Cranial Field involves a gentle hands-on approach to free the areas of the body in which motion has become restricted.  The hands on evaluation and treatment is the perfect compliment to Functional Medicine by giving  critical information on the progress of interventions and by augmenting our body's ability to return to health. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Initial visits can last up to one hour and follow-up visits up to 30 minutes. After a thorough history is obtained, the patient receives an Osteopathic structural and functional examination. A detailed history including a Functional Medicine Timeline and other intake forms, and a physical and Osteopathic evaluation and treatment occurs in the first visit. With complicated issues, treatment approaches and lab investigation may not all occur on the initial visit, but will be decided over the course of  several visits due to the fact that this practice has an insurance model which only allows for a certain amount of time for each visit.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,More than 20 years experience in neurology (Board Certified, ABPN), I have a broadly representative practice where I see patients with migraine, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, sleep disorders, neuromuscular diseases, and a variety of symptoms presentations, including numbness, weakness, fatigue, imbalance, memory loss, involuntary movements, headache and other pain syndromes.  My practice integrates the tools of conventional neurology with the skillset of functional medicine.  I do accept insurance for conventional neurology while functional medicine is a direct pay, multidisciplinary program called ""Brain Tune Up.""  I invite you to read more about it on my website.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I offer a comprehensive approach to functional medicine, called ""Brain Tune Up.""  My team and I see people from around the country who are willing to commit to an intensive personalized lifestyle medicine program aimed at reversing the effects of chronic neurological disease.  Currently, I am the only physician in the world to be certified by Dr. Terry Wahls as a Wahls Protocol Health Professional and the only practicing neurologist (M.D.) to be certified by IFM.  Additionally, I have received training in The Bredesen Protocol for reversal of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, and regularly receive referrals from Dr. Bredesen's group in California.  ,

                    ,I began my functional medicine training in 2010 and opened my own functional medicine practice in 2012.  In 2015 I was officially certified by IFM.  After spending over a decade in the fast pace of primary care family practice, I am so thankful to have new tools to help reverse chronic disease and create health.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I spend significant time with my patients working through their entire life history in order to uncover the different factors that have contributed to their current state of health.  Then we work together to address the imbalances and resolve the root causes of disease and dysfunction.  Please visit my practice web site to get more details about my practice, appointment costs, and the functional medicine approach to health.  I provide functional medicine consults and follow up to patients, but I do  not serve as a primary care provider.  All of my patients have their own primary care physician to manage acute illness and conventional health maintenance items.  I have a Functional Medicine Health coach working with me as well.,

                    ,If you feel lousy, 'off', sick or have joint pain, rashes, headaches, anxiety, depression, can't lose weight, fatigue (no matter how much sleep you get), insomnia, memory problems and your doctor can't 'find' anything wrong (or your lab tests are normal) I am the physician for you! I have helped hundreds of people with similar problems. It doesn't matter if you have one problem or multiple we will work with you to diagnose and treat the underlying cause(s) and prevent further problems.  Our team includes myself (functional medicine trained Medical Doctor), a nutritionist and health coach. I am a traditionally trained medical doctor. Also, we are trained to implement the Bredesen Protocol.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Our practice has a comprehensive approach to diagnosis, treatment and prevention. We take an extensive history (ask you many, many questions), obtain traditional and 'alternative' lab tests, recommend diet changes, self care regimens, and educate you at the same time. In addition to detoxification regimens we may recommend supplements (vitamins, minerals, amino acids and herbs). Pharmaceuticals are also able to be used if needed. A patient is an essential partner in the entire  process.,

                    ,Naturopathic and Functional medicine, general and family practice with an emphasis on metabolic diseases, weight management, pain management, lyme, frequency specific micro-current therapy, functional testing and vaccine alternatives. Clinic services also include chinese medicine, acupuncture, classical homeopathy, colic hydrotherapy, massage and midwifery.,
,
Our focus is on complex cases including lyme, pain management, infertility, metabolic diseases, and chronic diseases. We are expanding the Frequency Specific Microcurrent shifts as well as the Autonomic Response Testing for complex cases including lyme. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,They should expect to be treated with respect and dignity, to be taken seriously, and to get results. They should also expect that we will not give them a quick diagnosis and suppressive treatments designed to mask symptoms, but rather to help them find out the root cause or causes of them medical concerns and goals. In short we will treat the cause and not the effect. What should you expect? You should expect to get better. ,
,
Our rule of thumb for long standing cases is that the patients should expect to spend 1 month for every year that they have been sick in recovery after we get down to the root cause of their concern. ,
,
Your health goals are our primary concern. ,

                    ,In your first visit, we will obtain a complete medical history. The key to functional medicine is treating each person as an individual and getting to the root cause of health problems. That generally entails a detailed conversation about your current state of health, health history, family history, diet, lifestyle habits, etc. At that point, we will discuss with you potential approaches and recommended laboratory workups. This visit will last approximately 75 minutes and is primarily an information gathering and sharing session. We may make some recommendations at this time, but most advice will be deferred until after lab and physical exam results are in and there has been time to thoughtfully consider your case.,

                    ,I absolutely love what I do!  My patients call me a medical detective.   As an IFM certified practitioner, I am very comfortable with all aspects of Functional Medicine.  I am licensed in Texas, Oregon, Washington, California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, and am also available for second opinion consultations with patients in any state and from around the world.,
,
I do not see Functional Medicine patients in person.  I do not serve as a primary care physician for patients.  I serve as a Functional Medicine consultant.  I most often give you a plan that you can work through with your in-person doctor.  It helps to make Functional Medicine more affordable and accessible for patients all over the world.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I practice Functional Medicine primarily through Telemedicine.   I meet with patients in person as required legally.  I do not accept insurance for my consultations.The main expectation you should have is that I will give you my full attention and recommendations based on my extensive training and experience.,

I will make sure your metabolism is reset, you discover food sensitivities, and that you have something sustainable when you are done with the program.,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Although the body can compensate for many injuries and insults, there are several factors causing inflammation and/or imbalances in metabolism that, over time, give rise to symptoms and what most people cause diseases.  I help patients find and correct these factors by going to the root cause of their symptoms rather than the overuse of medications.  My patients find that by addressing their lifestyle, nutrition, stress, environment, and genetic susceptibilities, they can regain control of their health and their happiness.  Many are even able to reduce or eliminate their medications once the other factors are improved.  Call me today to find out how I can best help you!,

                    ,Medicine today can v be quite disparate in it;s findings and conflicting with different recommendations. It can be a maze for individuals seeking answers.,
I believe that there needs to be a relationship between the health care provider and the client,  based on the development of mutual understanding and trust, and the individual goals.,
 Functional Medicine consists of different modalities  of investigating all the different systems which may lead to dis-ease or one factor can manifest in different systems.  , which includes the heart-emotional, mental,  and spiritual,  as well as the physical  aspects of disease. The idea of epigenetics, means me can modify the genetics we were born with.  This is through lifestyle changes.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,People are individuals,  with there own unique stories.  and expectations.  The  initial questionnaires may seem really long and if they seem that way to you,  it is OK not to answer them all at once.  Your own personal goals,  and how you wish to address  your concerns  is of paramount importance.  We will work together to meet your goals. ,

                    ,Using a comprehensive, functional medicine approach, I integrate the latest scientific medical research on genetics, detoxification,bio-identical hormones, nutrition, and medicinal herbs along with deep mindfulness to the unfolding psychospiritual journey in creating health. Even though gynecology is my background, I also see men, as many of the same health and hormonal challenges can be approached and resolved through the integrative, whole systems lens of Functional Medicine.,

                    , The Five Stones Wellness medical practice, the IFMC, was founded on  my personal belief that true health comes from being in balance; in body, mind and spirit. As such, our approach is built on the Five Stones of Wellness. These include healthful eating, balanced movement, integrative healthcare, mindful stress management and interconnected living.,
A Certified Functional Medicine physician, and Board certified in Family as well as Integrative and Holistic Medicine, I  look for the underlying root causes of a patient's symptoms and condition,  including genetic, lifestyle, environmental, mental and spiritual factors that have brought them to where they are, and offer an integrative individualized approach to their healing.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients who come to IFMC will have a full Functional Medicine assessment of their symptoms and conditions, and then a personalized treatment plan will be created. They will be supported by a team of professionals in addition to their physician, and may be offered a variety of therapies, including nutrition counseling and coaching, personal training, acupuncture, botanical and conventional medicines, nutritional supplements, energy medicine, acupuncture, massage, hypnosis and acupuncture. The expectation is that each patient will be treated as an individual and supported along their healing journey.,

                    ,Functional Dentistry is the application of the principles and practices of Functional Medicine with the practice of the art and science of Dentistry. Philosophical differences exist today between traditional Evidence-Based Dentistry and Biological Dentistry, which have an impact on all patients and their oral and systemic health. When we apply Functional Medicine concepts in the course of dental examination, diagnosis and treatment, the ?one size fits all? philosophy of standard American dentistry becomes outdated and dentists transform from ?molar mechanics? to true ?physicians of the mouth.? We work closely with our patient?s physicians, and coordinate a patient?s dental treatment with the efforts of their other health care providers.,

                    ,We practice from the perspective that the body will only find healing when the body, mind and soul are treated as a whole. We believe that all healing comes from God and that He has given us the tools to find the most vibrant health.  ,
Because no one on earth can escape the hazards of our environment, there is a growing awareness that a large part of the healing process depends upon detox cleansing, and herbal treatments to help the body rid itself of toxins. Each of the natural healing laws are based on helping the body to detox. Every treatment we offer at Therapia is based on this inherent principle that the body will heal itself if given the proper environment.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,The Center for Ultra Health focuses on your digestive health front and center as digestive health is the foundation for health as a whole. Without proper digestion, absorption, and gut microbiota balance, systemic disease will arise in various forms. By treating the root cause(s) of disease, we can help you to restore balance to your system and alleviate symptoms of disease while restoring health as a whole.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We require all patients to complete a thorough, online questionnaire to explore your family history, personal history, and current symptoms. Once potential patients complete the questionnaire, we will review your answers and determine if we are a good fit for your health concerns. Not all patients will be accepted, especially if we deem that your health issues are outside of our scope of practice.,
,
Because our work focuses on digestive health as one of the major underlying contributors to health concerns, patients can expect to make major changes in diet. We often ask our patients to eliminate certain inflammatory foods or food groups for periods of time. As this can be difficult, we offer health coaching to assist with lifestyle changes.,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,A patient can expect a comprehensive evaluation.  During this time we can work on building a physician-patient partnership.  Appropriate labs can be ordered that include both traditional blood work as well as functional labs that will be ordered based on the patients specific concerns. A follow up visit  will involve interpretation as well of review of labs ordered.   During that time we will develop a patient treatment plan, based on discussed goals and results of test.  The patient can then choose to continue the plan and work with me as a patient-partner and begin their journey to health.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,In these changing times of medicine with the quick ""pill for an ill"" approach which makes for shorter less personal office visits, I found a much more meaningful approach to practicing medicine that not only gets to the root cause of issues, but also involves the patient in improving their health and wellness.  Functional Medicine has allowed me to get back to the way medicine used to be and should be. But in order to provide a more comprehensive approach, in addition to insurance, I use a membership model which allows more time with my patients in order to educate and be available to my patients giving them more peace of mind as well. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,My patients are welcomed into a warm, friendly, pleasant environment. In 2014, I converted to Personalized membership medicine in order to provide better care. The patient numbers are smaller so more time is spent getting to know, care and treat them more in depth. My emphysis is getting to the root cause of problems and then helping them improve more naturally with better health for their lifetime.,

                    ,Our goal is to get our patients from where you are now (stuck with significant chronic health issues) to where you want to be (in great health, able to focus on pursuing what is meaningful to you in life). We see both kids and adults.,
,
We look for underlying causes of chronic illness, including nutrient deficiencies, intestinal permeability, chronic infections, toxic exposures, and lifestyle issues. We work to optimize brain function, improve digestion, sleep and mood, eliminate pain, and raise energy.,
,
After the initial in-person visit, we offer the option of phone visits for follow up.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Our first task is to develop a ""theory of illness"": How have these symptoms come about? How will we unravel this situation to restore the conditions that lead to full health? We use coordinated lifestyle interventions: diet, stress reduction, and supplements. We blend an ancestral perspective with scientific cutting edge discoveries.,

                    ,I am here and I am listening, to help empower you to take to take back your health! I specialize in a functional medicine approach to Rheumatological disorders and Inflammatory conditions. I start with a full-workup and advanced laboratory testing to determine what course of action is best to take and then we work together to implement the nutrition, lifestyle and medical interventions.,
,
In My practice in Bryan, I work with patients once-on-one. My practice in Dallas is in one of the premier Integrative Functional Medicine Centers with over 22 integrated specialists available to work as your team in helping you get and stay well.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,To start, you will fill out your LivingMatrix Functional Medicine history and timeline which helps put your symptoms, diagnoses and health concerns into the functional medicine timeline.  From this information, we glean key insights into the possible triggering events and other issues that may be contributing to your health concerns. You can expect a 1.5-hour first appointment with me to go through your history, create our course of action and determine next steps and testing. At the end of this appointment, you will have key actions to start on immediately. Then once tests are back we then create your plan for your program based on the lab results and health,
In Dallas, I am available two Fridays out of the month currently for appointments.,

                    ,RMANJ has been at the forefront of patient-focused fertility treatment for nearly two decades. While our locations and partnerships continue to grow, we’ve never lost sight of our primary goal: helping our patients achieve their parenthood goals.,
,
We blend scientific expertise and leadership with patient-centered care. We want you to have a positive experience – one that is personal, professional and provides you with the best chances to start or continue building your family. Our entire staff in all of our 10 offices understands that one size does not fit all and will personalize your care based on your individual needs.  Dr Bergh has a special interest in functional medicine and blending a more holistic approach with new technologies.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,At RMANJ, our primary focus is treating infertility.  We understand the importance of becoming a family, because we are one. For almost twenty years, our physicians, nurses, and staff have worked together toward the common goal of helping our patients become parents. Our innovative procedures and patient centered care give patients the best possible outcomes and we continue leading the way with infertility options.  ,
,
Addressing infertility via a functional medicine perspective while still being able to offer cutting edge technologies has proven to be a very effective approach with many of our most challenging patients, ,

                    ,Focused on restoring and maintaining health to the maximum and not just putting out fires.  Seek to restore and maintain health as God designed us to be.  Treat from birth to death optimizing quality of life- not just quantity.  Do no do consults as I want to focus my time and attention to patients that I can care for,  for life and as we overcome obstacles, work to keep them away.   Work to help people treat their bodies as a temple of God as it was designed to be optimizing our God given ability to heal and repair even when it appears that it is not possible.  Emphasize the role of nutrition, sleep, optimal biomechanics, physiology/function and fueling your body with positive food and eliminating negative influences as much as possible.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Due to often times unexpected patient health issues, deliveries, patient crises and the complex wholistic nature of my practice, we often do not run on schedule though we do respect your time.  We do try to call patients when their appointment time is drawing near to minimize their wait at the office but this is not always predictable.  We care for our patients as family and do our best to not just identify your problems, but help you do what you can to both manage them and hopefully work to resolve or lessen their impact on your life.,

,
My focus is on re-balancing and restoring functional, nutritional, and lifestyle issues. Including metabolic dysfunction and hormonal dysregulation. ,
,
The 7 keys for practicing Functional Medicine are:,
Optimize nutrition,
Balance hormones,
Reduce inflammation,
Fix digestion,
Enhance detoxification,
Boost energy metabolism,
Calming the mind and therefore supporting the autonomic nervous system,

                    ,A big part of Functional Medicine is exploring your personal history in detail. Considering the whole person helps me see your health in context and not just in terms of your physical symptoms. We will design a treatment plan together which will likely include changes in your lifestyle. This includes what you eat, your physical activity, how you deal with stress, your exposure to potential toxins, in addition to personalized interventions.,
,
You can expect to find a dedicated practitioner who will listen carefully to your concerns and dig deeper to find the answers on your quest to optimal health.,

Some methods used include  Neurofeedback, HeartMath, Hyperbaric Oxygen, Far Infrared Sauna, Alpha- Stim, Advanced Nutrient Therapy, Vielight, Ionic Footbath.

                    ,As a naturopathic doctor, registered nurse, and clinical nutritionist, I apply my experience in both functional/alternative and conventional medicine to bring about optimal outcomes for my clients, addressing the underlying imbalance causing symptoms rather than masking and suppressing symptoms with drugs and procedures.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I will take a thorough history of your health concerns, and then we will discuss different options regarding how to proceed. Most of my new clients will start with some cutting edge functional medicine testing as well as dietary recommendations to get them started on their journey toward optimal health. Each client is an individual, and I do not have set ""packages"" to offer.  I create a personalized program for every client that comes to me.,

                    ,PPG Integrative Medicine is a large integrative medicine practice with three physicians, two nurse practitioiners and one physician assistant. Most of us are either certified IFM practitioners or in the middle of the training. We have a varied set of backgrounds that compliment each other, including internal medicine, family medicine, OB/GYN (we do not do annual pap exams or OB care) and pain management. Our varied backgrounds provide for a broad base of skills from which to draw in order to assist you reaching your goals. We also have excellent nutrition support and are affiliated with a group that provides body work and self-help classes, including massage, yoga, smoking cessation and mindfulness-based stress reduction.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Your initial visit will be an hour, and you will also be scheduled for a nutrition consult and introductory class at the time you make your initial appointment. The introductory class goes into a lot of depth about the foundations of gut health, dietary changes and choices and how those things relate to your overall health. Because nutrition is the foundation of wellbeing, everyone sees the nutritionist at least once. We focus on building a partnership with you to help you achieve your goals with targeted and individualized care. We also provide you with access to My Chart, an online portal that provides access to your test results and an easy way to connect with your provider should you have questions or need an appointment. ,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Women's Hormone Health strives to empower women to find hormone balance naturally - always looking for the source of imbalance.  After working with women's health for the last 17yrs., we don't need to start with birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy to find  the source of hormone imbalance.  Supporting the adrenals, the thyroid, detoxification and insulin response by using whole nutrition, mind-body techniques and natural herbs & supplements can often slow or reverse chronic hormone imbalance and autoimmune disease. Functional lab testing is often the most efficient way to direct personalized care for our patients and we use Labcorp, Direct Labs, Spectracell, Genova, BioHealth, DUTCH and more advanced functional laboratories.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,As a current or potential patient of our clinic, you are welcome to join our online Facebook community at Women's Hormone Health and our closed FB group #MoreThanMenopause for integrative support and guidance for your BEST health.,
,
As a clinic patient, you are welcomed into a beautiful, serene atmosphere for a confidential initial consultation combining Chinese Medicine and Functional Medicine practices.  The initial visit is 60-90 minutes and afterward, you will receive a complete treatment plan and report of findings within the week.  It is optional to receive acupuncture treatments, but most of our patients look forward to their treatments as part of our synergistic program treating Mind, Body and Spirit. ,

                    ,Live Fit Medicine is a medical practice in San Francisco founded by former ER physician, Rich Stagliano, M.D. Our practice is grounded in the principles of Functional Medicine that treats the root causes of poor health, not the symptoms. Dr. Stagliano practices a model of medicine that is holistic, patient-centered and individualized, drawing from both conventional medicine and evidence-based functional and integrative therapies.,
,
Dr. Stagliano’s mission is to help his patients restore and foster optimal health through a holistic approach utilizing primarily natural modalities. He is dedicated to finding root cause answers for patients while also empowering them to be the best “CEO” of their long term health and vitality. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We serve individuals who are interested in taking charge of their health and playing an active role in their own healing process by prioritizing the building blocks of health (nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress management, lifestyle and supplementation when appropriate) over medication and procedures.  Dr. Stagliano takes the time to listen to a patient’s complete health history and concerns and to look at ALL the factors that may be interacting to produce complex health issues. He then works with his patients to define their long term health goals and to develop a highly targeted treatment plan that treats the whole person, body and mind. Along the way, he always treats his patients as equal partners in the healing process. ,

                    ,Ultimate healing occurs from within.  I am honored and privileged to serve as a facilitator in this process.  In fulfilling this role my goal is to provide compassionate state-of-the-art care. Modern medicine and surgery have a lot to offer, but the human element in the doctor-patient relationship remains at the heart of healing.  I approach each patient as a unique and whole individual, not an isolated diseased organ.  Healing is an active process for the patient; my role is to guide and facilitate.  I believe the physical, psychological and spiritual state of the patient must be taken into consideration to optimize healing and recovery from illness.,

This allows you to really be in charge of improving your own health and changing the outcome of disease.I integrate traditional Western medical practices with ?alternative? and ?integrative? approaches.  Laboratory testing panels are utilized that are beyond the limited screening tests that are generally performed as part of an annual physical.  Therapeutic approaches that are prescribed include combinations of drugs and/or botanical medicines, supplements, specific diets, exercises, stress-management techniques, as well as state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical procedures.,

                    ,Functional Medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. It is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better addresses the healthcare needs of the 21st century. By shifting the traditional disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered approach, Functional Medicine addresses the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms. Functional Medicine practitioners spend time with their patients, listening to their histories and looking at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and complex, chronic disease. ,

We understand that every patient is a unique individual and they have an active roll in reaching their health goals..,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,All new patients fill out an extensive history on the patient portal prior to the first visit.  This helps us to use our time more efficiently at the initial visit.  The first visit takes from 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  This is essential to understanding the patient's history and factors which contribute to the present situation.  At the end of this visit, the patient will be given a personalized functional prescription, which includes a dietary and lifestyle prescription, possibly supplements or medications, and laboratory testing as indicated.  A follow up visit may be scheduled to assess progress and follow up with laboratory testing.  We also offer health coaching to help support patients in making lifestyle changes to reach their health goals.,

                    ,We often hear from individuals and families who are concerned about their own declining health, the health of their parents, and the health of their children. They seek guidance from our team to implement our proprietary three-step process called The Precision Health Process. This process is founded on the science of functional medicine and provides each client with their own customized plan to address the cause of their symptoms to restore health and experience vitality.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,The Precision Health proprietary process is founded on our three core principles. 1) Address the Cause: Evaluations, assessments, care, and recommendations are all geared toward finding and addressing the underlying cause of symptoms, diagnosis or dysfunction. 2) Personalize Care: Each individual is unique and all care and recommendations are geared toward the participant's goals, findings, lab results and genetics (not a one size fits all approach) and 3) Partnerships: Our team of practitioners partners with each participant working with and alongside them. ,

                    ,I was an academic physician training residents in Ophthalmology, Neurology, Neurosurgery and Pediatrics for over 30 years and certified by the IFM in functional medicine several years ago. I practice consultations in Neuro-ophthalmology, uniquely combining my knowledge of functional medicine with conventional Neuro-ophthalmic practice. ,
I can offer consultations in Nutrition and Life Style as well. I do not practice primary care medicine, however. I can do consultations by email or by phone as well. I also have extensive experience in the use of Botox for medical issues (blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm and hyperhydrosis) and cosmetic uses.,
I can help you navigate the difficult medical system we have in addition to helping with alternatives.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,After a questionnaire is filled out on line or by mail, a review of past medical historical documents, a lengthy (2 hr) interview and examination is conducted. A detailed assessment of the patient's unique issues is discussed; this will be followed by those biochemical tests and GI tests deemed necessary. A comprehensive plan of diet, supplements and life style changes will be made and close follow up done to monitor the patient's progress.,

                    ,What I enjoy most is solving medical problems that may have baffled other doctors. By listening to patients carefully the complex connections between underlying risk factors, physical symptoms and emotional triggers can be identified. Careful analysis of the interplay of these factors often leads to the identification of several key root causes. Once these root causes have been addressed usually the pieces of the puzzle come together. I look forward to partnering with you so we can formulate the best course of action together.,

                    ,I have enjoyed the privilege of developing meaningful, supportive relationships with my patients, which has been my favorite, most fulfilling aspect of practicing Functional and Family Medicine. Because of this, I am excited about my new personalized medicine practice which will open for accepting and scheduling patients on July 2, 2018. This type of practice will allow me the ability to build on and improve these relationships with a high level of personalized care, focused more on wellness and prevention.,
,
The healthcare landscape is changing in ways that make it difficult to provide the high quality of care that my patients deserve. My smaller, more personalized practice will allow individuals to receive exceptional primary care.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,These are just a few of the many benefits you will experience:,
•	Develop a trusting relationship with your own provider.,
•	Direct availability to your provider via cell, text, video conference, or email throughout the year, and possibly eliminating the need for an appointment altogether.,
•	Extended and relaxed office visits so all your questions can be addressed, and to explore more deeply the root cause of issues and create a plan for optimal health.,
•	Same-day or next-day appointments for your convenience, and brief or no office wait time so you can get on with your day.,
•	Guidance and care coordination in the event of need for specialty referrals or hospital stays.,

                    ,We take care of patients with a wide variety of medical problems. The treatment involves life style, dietary support, and the repletion of functional biochemistry.  One of the special areas that we treat is heavy metal toxicity with oral or IV chelation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is another modality that we use to treat a variety of problems including soft tissue and bone injuries, pre and post surgery, and autistic children to gain speech. Other areas of treatment include but are not limited to ADHD, allergy, depression, anxiety, concussion and traumatic brain injury, hormone therapy for men and women, and IV nutrient support for cancer patients. The medical diagnoses to include diabetes, heart disease and hypertension are also treated. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,The patients have been amazed and delighted at the outcomes. They have been treated mainly with pharmaceutical agents prior to coming to our clinic. They have brought in relatives and friends who have benefited also. We have a strong spiritual base among the employees and their care of the patients is genuine and compassionate. Functional medicine has made a tremendous difference for the practitioners as well as the patients. We look forward to each day and expect to see delighted patients after they have experienced our treatment.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Bringing together his training as both a clinical psychologist and a naturopathic doctor, Dr. Ducat specializes in integrative mental health. This is a new but growing clinical synthesis that refers to the joining of psychotherapy with science-based natural medicine and nutrition. Dr. Ducat's treatment philosophy is founded on a systems approach to biology, which views the body/mind as a network of differentiated yet linked physiological and psychological processes. One can neither understand nor treat an illness, mental or physical, without taking into account the entire web of relationships -- psychodynamic, biochemical, genetic, social, and environmental -- from which all symptoms emerge. Dr. Ducat sees patients in Bend, OR and online.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients can expect Dr. Ducat to treat them as respected collaborators in their care, listen to their story, gather a comprehensive history, order lab tests that can yield actionable findings, and then assemble all this data into a treatment plan based on causes, rather than diagnostic labels.,

                  ,Information for Patients,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I have been an RN for 31 years and worked in a variety of emergency departments and home care settings. I received my master's degree in nursing from IU in 2004 as a family nurse practitioner. Then I worked in a family practice setting for a hospital system. I have been studying and applying functional medicine to help my patients since about 2010. On March 6, 2017 I opened my own clinic, which is a long time dream of mine! Are you tired of getting a pill for your diagnosis or symptom and still not feeling well? Would you like to get to the root cause(s) of your problem(s) and be energetic and whole? I am here to help!  Common conditions/symptoms I am able to help you with include fatigue, thyroid issues, weight gain, hormone issues & more.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,You can expect to be listened to and respected as a unique individual in our small, friendly clinic. You will be treated like family! I will take a very detailed history and perform a physical exam appropriate to your situation. Then, together with you, decide if any testing could help identify your problem(s). At subsequent visits we will develop a treatment plan based upon your health goals. These will be based on your unique needs and will include, but not be limited to, coaching on living a healthy lifestyle. Call today for an appointment so you can get started back on the path to wholeness! I look forward to helping you!,

                  ,Information for Patients,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,At SEE Wellness, with the help of health coaches, I use a Nutritional emphasis in healing both body and mind.  I use Gentle detox strategies, genetic evaluation of your 23 and Me lending to overall clinical improvement, bio-identical hormones if indicated, and cardiovascular prevention with CIMT and advanced markers. Help for increased intestinal permeability, ""leaky gut"" and SIBO, and all related chronic problems, such as neurological, autoimmune and hormonal issues. I have a special focus on helping with cognitive decline and early dementia. At this time, I am accepting new consult patients.  Patients have a visit with me and then one of my nurses or health coaches to implement the plan we come to together.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,New patient visits are one and a half to two hours in length.  I use online questionnaires to gather information prior to each visit. My staff will contact you to obtain as much pertinent medical record as possible prior to your visit.  Some follow-ups are via Skype or phone. I offer monthly kitchen group-office visits in my Comfort location.  These present easy, practical food choices to help with various health concerns.  No one leaves hungry.  Patients learn a lot from me, my health coaches and from each other helping them to easily adopt salutary changes.,

                    ,The Functional Medicine  model is one that truly resonates with me and as such forms the bedrock of my practice. The principles of FM is anchored by an unraveling of the core imbalances that underlie, or cause ill health, and not simply offering solutions to the symptoms of a condition. There are many conditions recognised as requiring unique recommendations and, as such I have taken undergraduate and postgraduate training to provide me with increased expertise in functional digestive conditions, hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's.,

                    ,I combine a skill-set from my 34-year practice as a Registered Dietitian with Functional Medicine to treat clients. To find the root cause of health problems, the first step is a Comprehensive Functional Nutrition Assessment where I explore lifelong history, lifestyle, environmental exposures, medical/social/genetic factors, diet, and nutrition status. From the assessment I assist clients in developing a Nutrition and Lifestyle Action Plan. In addition to education and counseling, clients receive a customized book containing: assessment results/recommendations; health-promoting lifestyle intervention goals; targeted therapeutic foods/supplements; an individualized diet plan, sample menu, recipes; and nutrition/health information.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Clients must be ready to make changes in their lifestyle and/or diet. The approach to healing or weight loss is through a whole, clean diet; movement; mindfulness; healthy lifestyle, and targeted supplements and foods as needed. Teri will assist the client in making changes in a comfortable, step-wise approach that are achievable. Clients are expected to work together with Teri to define their goals for diet and lifestyle change and health improvement. The attainment of a positive outcome is dependent in large part upon the attitude and effort of the patient. Follow up may be needed to obtain a favorable result and complex chronic health problems often take a commitment for change from the individual, a team effort, and time.,

                    ,Each person presents to the clinic with his or her own diet, lifestyle, psychosocial issues, environmental factors and genetic influences. At 3rd Opinion we try to understand these unique variables at a deep level. For us the question is not “What disease do you have?” but rather “Why would you have that disease?” These are very different questions and they lead to very different opportunities. As an example, if you carry a diagnosis of arthritis, the treatment is anti-arthritis medicine. If you ask the question “Why do you have arthritis?” it may lead to a fundamental understanding of your unique biochemistry.,

                    ,My goal is to teach you how to find optimal health. I like to stay up to date with current scientific topics and nutritional therapies that will give you the best clinical outcomes. Beyond my 10 years of training with the Institute for Functional Medicine, I have also been a medical affairs member at Thorne Research and a member of the Autism Research Institute Scientific Roundtable. I now teach for IFM as part of their education team but for the last 8 years I have also coached hundreds of practitioners in Functional Medicine during my online Progressive Practitioner Coaching Program. I use the handouts from this course to teach my clients how their body works and what they can do to take charge of their health. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I look at people as being unique and complex individuals that have very specific needs. You will see that I do an extensive intake process and recommend Functional Medicine lab testing to get to the root of your health issues. Many people come to see me when all other treatments have failed them. As a participant in the design and research of nutritional supplements, I also have a wealth of information to share regarding their proper use. My book entitled The Elimination Diet has helped hundreds of thousands of people across the globe and I share their case studies to inspire you to make positive changes in your life. ,

                    ,In my psychiatry practice I apply the principles of Functional Medicine to address the root causes of your symptoms. Many people are dissatisfied with simply taking a medication for symptoms, especially when they experience limited efficacy and side effects. Many are working with therapists but are limited in their success by their brain's limited ability to change due to nutrient deficiencies and inflammation.  I partner with you to identify and treat these deficiencies and sources of inflammation.  I empower you to make change by supporting you with a health coach and therapist in my clinic. ,

                    ,Our dental practice is best described as ""Functional Dentistry"" based on the functional medicine model as well as those set forth by the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology.  Personalized dental treatment plans are created balanced with a personal health evaluation & analysis in order to guide patients to health and well being. Without a strong foundation of oral health it is challenging to arrive at whole body health and well being. Our practice is a non-mercury and latex free environment and we follow IFM and IAOMT protocol for safe amalgam/mercury removal.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We deliver comprehensive dental treatment while following a functional medicine based health plan. We partner together with patient and other functional medicine practitioners to develop a careful and thorough analysis of dental needs along with a complete examination of personal health factors and goals.,

                    ,A consultation with Dr O'Brien is like visiting a friend who is your advocate in whole health and wellness. As a physician, I bring to our partnership the skills and training I received through Western medicine training in surgery and family medicine paired with certification through the Institute for Functional Medicine to utilize a whole body, systems-based approach in a mind-body-spriit paradigm to find and address the root causes of disease. I prefer to help you heal your body with modification of diet and lifestyle rather than treat any disease with a drug or supplement.,
,
Our relationship as partners, each with important work, is foundational to your success. My practice is small, personal, and patient-centered.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,My goal is to be a physician-partner to my patients. We spend approximately 90 minutes to 3 hours together at your initial consultation forging our partnership and identifying your health goals and challenges. You receive a custom plan after your visit that addresses food, movement, lifestyle modifications, supplement recommendations, medications, and suggested labs. Patients then decide if they would like to pursue the proposed treatment plan and join me as patient-partner.,
,
Full descriptions of each appointment and the overall experience you can expect with my practice can be found on the website. I applaud your efforts to change your health and would love to walk alongside you on your journey to whole health and wellness.,

                    ,**Visit my website (www.DrVeronica.com) to see and hear real client testimonials** Hello Health Seeker. I'm Dr. Veronica Anderson. I am a Medical Intuitive, Homeopath and Functional Medicine Practitioner. If you feel like the healthcare system has failed you and you are ready to move in a direction that can help you, then schedule a consultation with me. First, I work COMPLETELY REMOTELY by phone and online coaching because that is how I am able to get you the results you are looking for. For those who are comfortable with the convenience of technology, this is ideal for you. My coaching style approach allows for us to talk and meet conveniently and also allows for support BETWEEN visits (that's where the rubber meets the road). ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Coaching and consultation session are done via secure online conferencing and phone. There are NO OFFICE VISITS.,
I do not write any pharmaceuticals at this point although I am licensed to do so because you are coming to me to get a different answer. I WiLL work with your other doctors should I find that pharmaceuticals are the only way as I feel I have an ethical and moral obligation to make sure you get what will work for you.,
,
Visits range from 30 to 60 minutes. Once the initial session is done, I recommend a membership subscription or package program to get results. Since Functional Medicine and Health require ongoing support the membership is the best way to allow for this style.,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We hope to help patients get to the root of their imbalance, rather than simply manage symptoms of a condition.  We help to inspire our patients to undergo whatever lifestyle change that is necessary, as most of us develop imbalances due to habits that decrease our health.  ,
Prior to your first visit, you'll be asked to fill out our intake forms, which are available on our website.  You'll be asked to bring along any labwork you already have so we don't unnecessarily repeat it.  You'll also be asked to bring along all of your supplements and prescription meds for our review.,

My goal is to have you successfully implement a sustainable, enjoyable meal plan that does not require calorie counting or long-term, highly restrictive diets. I work *with you* to find what will work *for you*. You can expect high levels of support, a lack of judgment, and an optimistic outlook at every session. Lifestyle changes can be hard and I do my best to make the process fun and tasty! ,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Healthcare with heart. This is a family medicine solo micro practice, meaning that I provide all the services offered in my one room office. I have no staff which allows me to take care of a smaller number of patients and focus as much time as is needed with each of you. Your phone calls and e-mails will often be answeredI prefer to rely more on healthy lifestyle and less on pharmaceuticals. My interests are strong in nutrition and in “food as medicine,” and as a result I am pursing certification in Functional Medicine. This will blend nicely as I enjoy collaborating with a wide array of traditional medical specialists and alternative holistic providers to provide patients with great healthcare. Time with patients is what I value the most. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I opened my solo micro Family Medicine practice to be able to offer slow medicine. What do I mean by ""slow""? Both as an employed physician and as a patient, I have experienced mainstream medicine to resemble an assembly line form of care. Patients who are motivated to understand why they have a medical problem, rather than just wanting a pill to solve the problem, often need longer appointments than typical 10-20 minute visits. Longer visits which can be up to 60 minutes or longer, allow more holistic healing and future health success. ,

                    ,I practice  Integrative Cardiology (Functional Medicine trained for over 15 years) and have 24 years of experience in Non-invasive cardiology(Board certified), especially clinical cardiology and echocardiography. I always try to use the least amount of medicines needed and do extensive lifestyle medicine and nutritional support. I am in a practice that is also Functional Medicine based and has a variety of services. I provide outpatient services only. My goal is to try and prevent the need for procedures and medicines whenever possible.,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,A thorough cardiac history and exam. I also look at the influence of other health problems. I screen for cardiac risk factors, work up symptoms and offer treatment to include lifestyle, diet support, nutritional support and if needed medical treatments or referrals, if needed, for acute care workup. I am especially interested in the prevention and reversal of heart disease, heart disease prevention in women,cardiology for athletes, the influence of the GI tract on cardiac disease and risk (including food allergies), EECP (non-invasive treatment for angina)  and improvement in quality of life, even with  chronic illness. ,

The Confluence approach to health & healing is founded in the philosophies of evidence-based Functional Medicine. It focuses on the whole person, not just a set of symptoms. It integrates the most current genetic, nutritional, & biochemical research with powerful tools for behavior change & a person-centered philosophy (rather than focusing on diseases!). Think of me as a your personal medical educator & wellness guide, providing you the tools to do more than recover from disease–to feel deeply well.,

                    ,We uncover the root cause of your health issues through extensive patient interviews, physical and neurological exams, dietary analysis, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), as well as genetic, nutritional, microbiome, heart rate variability, and functional diagnostic testing. We believe doctor means teacher and together, with the patient, both work together as a team to tailor a personalized natural treatment program based on our findings and your goals. Healing programs are designed holistically to treat the whole body, not the disorder. We utilize integrative protocols such as botanical and vitamin therapy, nutrition, food plans, homeopathy, health coaching, HeartMath biofeedback,  stress modification, and lifestyle interventions.,

                    ,At ROOTED  we implement therapeutic nutrition programming with targeted supplementation based upon the underlying biochemical, metabolic, genetic and lifestyle differences that make each individual unique.  With proper nutrition, our bodies have the right resources to heal and work more efficiently. Our programs provide a comprehensive approach to help each individual reach their desired health goals.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Our initial consultation involves a detailed assessment and health history utilizing the LivingMatrix platform to gain a thorough view into the current health status of our clients.  From here we will identify any core imbalances and make our clinical nutrition analysis.  Depending upon the unique presentation of each client we will then provide therapeutic nutrition programming and targeted supplementation recommendations based upon each individual's unique needs.  At this time we can also recommend further functional lab testing, as necessary.  Our main goal is to provide an environment that is supportive to the needs of our client while walking with them through their journey of healing.,

                    ,I work with individuals who have reached the tipping point in their own health. Who may have seen multiple doctors and know that the root cause isn’t being addressed.

                    ,Carolina Total Wellness provides the highest level of personalized care. We believe that each individual requires a unique set of interventions to optimize his/her health and wellness. Our providers integrate their extensive experience in ""traditional"" Western medicine with natural treatments and functional medicine to create an individualized approach. We work with the patient and patient's care team to discover the root cause of their health issues and co-create a path toward health and vitality.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,A patient at Carolina Total Wellness can expect individualized care, ongoing communication, and respect. Extensive web based questionnaires before the first visit help focus and optimize our time during initial evaluation. Lab work is typically recommended at the first visit, results of which will be reviewed the second visit for adaptation of the treatment plan.,
For our pediatric patients, we may recommend an online video conference between Blair and the patient's caregiver for the initial discussion of concerns.  To complete the initial visit, an on-site pediatric exam is scheduled. Subsequent followup appointments are on-site.,
For all patients, we work with a certified health coach to help put the plan into action and optimize outcomes.,

                    ,My functional nutrition consulting business is a telenutrition model that allows for me to work with patients from all over the country. I focus on digestive issues, fatigue, brain fog, cognitive decline and metabolic syndrome. I create customized nutrition plans that commonly stem from a ketogenic diet, gluten-free/dairy-free, or the renew plan. I also provide a subscription based program, the Functional Feed, which includes monthly GF/DF meal plans, recipes and shopping lists. I started my functional medicine career as one of the founding dietitians of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine in 2014. Since then I have gone into private practice in addition to co-creating and teaching a graduate course in functional nutrition.,

                    ,Next Advanced Medicine is an interdisciplinary medical practice in Irvine that focuses on the treatment and reversal of chronic disease and pain. By shifting the traditional disease-centered focus of health care to a more patient-centered approach, functional medicine addresses the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms or label of disease. We spend time with our patients, listening to their histories and looking at the interactions among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and complex, chronic disease. Our treatment approach often brings results that maximize the individual's success throughout the entire process.

                    ,Alma Family Medicine is an inviting family practice clinic in Santa Fe where you can count on receiving compassionate care that all patients deserve. I practice traditional and integrative medicine; I have a Master's Degree in Human Nutrition, practiced functional nutrition prior to becoming a PA-C and if appropriate would be excited to help you manage your medical condition with nutrition if that is your preference. In any case whether you have a chronic condition and have seen a long list of health care professionals with inadequate relief or you are generally healthy and just want to keep an eye on things I would be happy to meet you where you're at and travel with you on your path to optimal wellness.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I practice in a traditional health insurance setting thus appointment times are 30 minutes (20-25 for us to visit and 5-10 for documentation). Please come to your visit knowing what you want to address (you can write it down and bring it with you if you wish!) so that we can set an agenda in the first few minutes of the visit to ensure that we have realistic expectations for what we can safely accomplish and what we may need to address at a future date. This also ensures that we don't overwhelm each other with too much information at once particularly when addressing lifestyle factors.,

                    ,We believe patients are unique in the way their bodies work all the way down to the cellular level. We believe their uniqueness is also evident in the way they choose to work their bodies, through the decisions they make, the emotions they develop, and the environment in which they live.  Our functional medicine approach is patient-centered to support true health. This means we consider spiritual and personal beliefs, attitudes, and motivations along with physical, mental, emotional, and environmental aspects of each patient. This approach does not consider the absence of disease to be the same as optimal health. Our MISSION is to meet your healthcare needs with compassion and skill in the manner of Jesus Christ, the Great Physician. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I specialize in holistic nutrition and believe the body functions best when it is supported by a nutrient rich diet of whole foods. Bioindividuality is also a central concept in my practice.  There are many diets and approaches to health described by books and blogs, but everyone is unique in their physiology and circumstance.  I have a background in ministry, psychology and counseling and also draw from these experiences as a part of my approach.  In terms of credentials, I am a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, a Certified GAPS Practitioner and am Board Certified in Holistic Nutrition.  My training is through the University of Western States, IFM and the Nutritional Therapy Association.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,It’s about a collaborative relationship.  During our time together, we’ll review your life story and identify the root causes for your current challenges.  We’ll partner in discussing how you can improve your health and reduce your stress by introducing you to foods your body will love.  We’ll also look at which foods may be inflammatory, allergenic, gas producing or fatigue inducing.  I offer a functional evaluation which involves the identification of digestive system stress points.  Through Lingual Neural Testing (LNT), I can test specific supplements on your body to determine compatibility.  Our time together is an opportunity for both partnership and education.  I enjoy seeing my clients thrive in their journey towards optimal wellness,

                    ,A big part of Functional Medicine is exploring your personal and family history in detail. You can expect to do a lot of talking in your first appointment. I may ask about your mental well being, spiritual health, and social factors. Considering these areas helps me see your health in the context of you as a whole person, not just in terms of your physical symptoms. The treatment plan we design together will likely include changes in your lifestyle: what you eat, your physical activity, how you deal with stress, your exposure to potentially toxic substances, and other factors. ,

Since 2011 I have immersed myself in the Functional Medicine community attending seminars and networking with other practitioners in this field.  I have a lot of experience in bio-identical hormone replacement therapies as well as detoxification strategies, autoimmune illness, fatigue, and fibromyalgia. More recently I have added IV therapies such as Myers cocktails, UBI/ozone, and Vit C, and chelation.  I have a pain management strategy designed to relieve pain by starting the healing process.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I am currently practicing under two models. The first is a consultation practice where someone may set up an appointment with me to begin a functional medicine consultation and follow ups.,
The second option is to see me at Heritage Family Medicine which is a membership practice with a set monthly fee. ,
,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,In my private consultation practice, we will meet for a couple of hours to get a complete medical history.  This will be followed by a 45-60 minute appointment a couple of weeks later to go over any lab results and to form a plan of action.  This  is then followed by another appointment usually 2-4 weeks later to see how you are responding and from there to determine how you want to proceed.,
In my membership model, you will have an initial consultation for about an hour to start the process of getting your full history.  We will meet again in a couple of weeks to finish that process and then from there meet as listed above.  In the membership model I also provide care for any other needs such as a complete physical, acute care, etc.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I'm a naturopathic physician who helps patients with autoimmune disease create the life they want through better health. I'm not just focused on making symptoms go away, I help get to the root of why they feel so bad. That's how my patient's enjoy a new life of wellness.  ,
,
With the whole-person in mind, I spend time with my patients addressing stuff most physicians never do. I believe that self-love, personal growth, and self-discovery have a powerful impact on healing with autoimmunity. I support patients from all over the world from my practice based in Oregon. In addition to seeing patients, I'm a speaker and regular contributor to several publications including The Huffington Post and Mind Body Green. ,

You will have monthly follow up appointments and weekly video/phone group appointments to answer all your questions.

                    ,I remain up-to-the-moment on evidence-based nutrition-medicine, reviews hundreds of studies per year and regularly attends integrative medicine conferences (>85 conferences from 2004-2017) all which impact me to better understand health issues and bridge emerging nutrition choices into your life.  I transform this technical information and teach each patient new scientific breakthroughs in nutrition and lifestyle medicine. My decades of clinical training as adjunct faculty in family medicine residency programs and Tulane Medical School teaching integrative nutrition and functional medicine allows me to bring functional medicine protocols into your health team, whether it be a allopathic physician or a functional medicine physician.   ,

                    ,My consultations utilize functional diagnostics (i.e, functional labs, biomarkers and genomic) to identify root causes and underlying imbalances.  We correct those imbalances using nutrition therapy and CBT (cognitive behavior therapy). I have advanced training in interpreting biomarkers & genomics but MOST important I educate you in simple ways that inspire action.  You can expect improved health outcome for the health condition(s) you are seeking to correct.,

                    ,Integrative Health Coaching is a creative process that bridges the gap between medical recommendations / health goals and the integration of them into your life.,
,
Integrative Health Coaching is an individualized approach. I help you to implement medical recommendations and achieve your goals, but I also know that you are the best person that knows how to make that happen. In this approach, we realize change is not linear, it takes time, and it is not isolated from the many other facets of our lives. The role of an Integrative Health Coach is to provide support through that change process and find what makes you thrive.,

                    ,I am a UCSF-trained, board-certified psychiatric nurse practitioner practicing in San Francisco and San Diego, California. I provide personalized medication evaluation and management services, and psychotherapy. I strive to address barriers in our healthcare system that I have time and again observed to have frustrated individuals’ attainment of their truest and healthiest potentials. These include time, cost, logistical challenges; approaching mental health from reductionist perspectives; and failing to identify and address root causes of distressing signs and symptoms. In my efforts to address mental health issues from a whole-person perspective, I have trained, and continue to train in the expanding field of functional medicine.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,My patients must expect to be fully participative in their care. Getting well often takes hard work! Treatment begins with a thorough diagnostic process that could spread over several weeks and appointments. Diagnostic interviews are supplemented by self-administered questionnaires and instruments, chart reviews from all previous medical and psychiatric encounters, referrals to and collaborations with primary and specialty care, and lab and genetic testing. The involvement of your chosen support team in this process is strongly encouraged. As a clearer picture emerges from this process, you will be presented with treatment options and my recommendations. If medications are a reasonable option for you, I will prescribe them.,

                    ,Our practice opened in 2004 in Washington, DC as the first Primary Care Nurse Practitioner practice.  Since inception we have provided one on one care from vital signs to diagnosis and treatment, just provider and patient the entire visit. We believe a patient's history is the biggest key in prevention, diagnosis and treatment.  We are also Certified Travel Health providers providing both pre-travel consults to anywhere in the world and post travel consults for patients who believe they may have contracted a travel related illness.  After seeing more chronic disease in our patients, we began our journey in to Functional Medicine to find the root cause of disease to better treat our patients.   Please see the Our Story page on our web site.,

We will explore the potential contributing factors in your current situation and begin the process of creating an individualized plan of care.  Testing may be necessary and is generally reviewed at the second appointment at which time further personalization of the care plan is accomplished.  I offer home visits for an additional nominal fee and free presentations on the functional medicine approach to healthcare to groups of 5 or more.  These can be done in the home, work or place of worship. ,

I may ask about your mental well being, spiritual health, and social factors. Considering these areas will allow me to see your health in the context of you as a whole person, not just in terms of your physical symptoms. The treatment plan we design together will likely include changes in your lifestyle: what you eat, your physical activity, how you deal with stress, your exposure to potentially toxic substances, and other factors. We will ask you to  fill out and bring your pre-appointment intake forms which will be sent to you via email in advance for your first visit.,

,
Using a functional medicine-based framework to uncover root causes of disease, we build with our patients a biochemically and psychosocially-driven analysis for understanding the whole-person health history throughout the life course. This framework includes gathering clues from your past and your present. These clues are systematically organized into antecedents, triggers, and mediators that converge to influence your current health state. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We regard our relationship with our patients as a collaboration. We help you understand the root causes of your disease and empower you to actively take back control of your health. This is done through therapeutic strategies that may include food as medicine, acupuncture, stress-management techniques, supplements, detoxification program, adjustment or reduction of prescription medications, and other integrative modalities such as qigong and mindfulness practice. We teach you the skills to help you recover from disease and create a sustainable path to health and wellbeing.,

                    ,I am passionate about incorporating Functional Medicine with Mind-Body Medicine.  I feel the healing is incomplete when either one is left out.  Having practiced Mind-Body Medicine for 5 years I have seen that there are metaphysical reasons for our dis-ease(s). I have seen rashes to chronic pain to open wounds heal spontaneously through the use of Mind-Body Medicine techniques.  When we work at the emotional level we catch the dis-ease at the root cause.   Physical illness is just a symptom of an energy blockage and once the emotion is release the physical symptoms resolve.  Feel free to read my blog if you wish to learn more about the process at https://lotushealinggardens.com/blog/. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients can expect to feel better if they are ready and willing to follow the recommendations and are willing to do their inner work.  There is no ""magic pill"" but rather guidance that will lead you far.  The key to your health is how much you are willing to implement the principles in your life.  You cannot heal by thinking the same thoughts that created your dis-ease to begin with.  I will guide you in rising above your thoughts so you can re-claim your health at all levels: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.  This process will help to expand your consciousness and will help to awaken you as that is where our true healing lies... In our awakening. ,

                    ,My practice is open to all, but my special interests is to assist those who cannot find the assistance they need through mainstream medicine.  Our initial appointment is for one hour -- for those patients whose medical history is complicated, an additional appointment of 30-60 minutes may be needed to complete the evaluation.  All initial appointments must be in-person; follow-up appointments may be via telephone.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,It is important to understand that chronic diseases take time to heal.  While I do have some patients who are ""cured"" after one appointment, this is not the usual case.  I am interested in addressing all of your concerns but it is necessary for you to be a partner in your path to healing.  This may require dietary and other lifestyle changes.  It may also include initial and follow-up labs (which insurance may or may not cover, depending on your insurance plan).  I am willing to work with you at your own pace.  Please contact my website or my office for further information.  I wish you well!,

She is passionate about all things nutrition and lifestyle, especially applied to a woman’s hormonal journey throughout lifetime.

Her aim is to provide each individual with the necessary information, tools and support to enable them to achieve positive lifestyle changes that improve their quality of life.,

                    ,I have been practicing primary care medicine in St. Mary's Count since 2000. I take my time to get to know my patients and try to figure out the underlying causes of symptoms and disease. I strongly believe in the power and effectiveness of natural treatments but will also recommend ""conventional"" therapies when appropriate. I spend about an hour during each office visit and when you contact my office you will only be talking to me.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I do not accept any insurance and unfortunately at this time I cannot see patients that have Medicare or Medicaid as their primary form of insurance. For other types of insurance I will provide an invoice that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement for my office visits. You would use your insurance for any labs or tests that I order. Please be patient when contacting my office as I work alone without any staff. Be assured however that I care about each and every patient I care for and will do my best to meet your healthcare needs. ,

                    ,We are delighted to introduce you to our women's functional medicine practice. Dr. Wei is a board-certified Ob/Gyn with 17 years of experience in conventional women's medical care. After pursuing extensive training in functional and integrative medicine, she now offers a unique opportunity to discover true health and vitality through restoring the natural rhythms and balance of your body. Restoring the body's balance will alleviate the symptoms of the common concerns many women face: fatigue, GI problems, depression and anxiety, difficulty maintaining an ideal weight, and female hormone balance issues such as menstrual cycle irregularities, fibroids, endometriosis, PMS, PCOS, fertility, perimenopause, and menopause.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Dr. Wei provides consultative functional medicine services only. Although she continues to be board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology, she has chosen to devote her time fully to functional medical care. She does require that you have ongoing regular care with your gynecologic care provider and with your primary care provider. If you do not have a gynecologic care provider, Dr. Wei is happy to provide references to providers who support a holistic approach to women's health.,

                    ,I practice both Functional Medicine and Regenerative Orthopedics.  I have a long interest in Functional Medicine, having taken my first A4M and ACAM courses (and chelation training) in 2001 and my first AFMPC from IFM in 2002.  I have taken many courses and belonged over the years from the American Academy of Environmental Medicine,  ACAM,  A4M and ILADS.  I consider myself and expert in chronic pain, fatigue and am particularly skilled at sorting out metabolic pain from problems that actually need surgery.  I enjoy my patient relationships and have helped hundreds of people over the years ""do the Matrix"" even while working in an orthopedic environment. Our clinic practices and Adagio sytle of medicine- relaxed and unhurried. ,

                    ,I have been practicing Functional Medicine for the last 4 years with my mentor, Joe Dimatteo, RPh, CCN, ND.  I treat the root cause of disease by taking a thorough history including past medical history, past family history, surgical history, medical timeline, diet, exercise, sleep, digestion, prescription medications, supplements, testing completed etc.  This information allows me to discuss a plan, with you, to improve your health.  I treat the whole person, body, mind and spirit.  I am a Christian and would be willing to pray for you if you would like.  The practice also includes a compounding pharmacy and if applicable, I can prescribe bioidentical hormones, compounded thyroid medications or prescriptive treatments.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I expect a comprehensive plan for you.  After all the above information is gathered, you are part of the decision-making process.  This may include, further testing, dietary changes, exercise implementation and supplementation.  Retesting may be necessary at some point.  We work together for your good health!  The fee for the consult is based on the amount of time spent during the consult and any additional testing or supplements.  Call Terri at 412-826-9500 to set up a consult.  ,

                    ,I am a physiatrist or specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation.  I practice at several locations but fully employ functional medicine only at this location. Primary interests are in neuromusculoskeletal medicine but  the overal metabolism as it affects function is focus of practice.,
We assess the metabolic and structural issues that are affecting your current level of function with the goal of developing a comprehensive interdisciplinary plan to address and manage these issues. The ultimate goal is to maximize your function with the least invasive and most sustaining approach.,

                    ,I have a Master’s of Science in Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine. I have been a personal trainer, boot camp instructor, health coach, and physical therapy technician, before deciding to return to school to find the underlying causes behind health obstacles. I now practice at a large integrative clinic, founded by renowned functional and anti-aging physician Joseph McWherter, MD. While the clinic as a whole focuses on women's health, I see all types of patients, young and old, male and female. I am especially interested in gut health, autoimmunity, brain health, thyroid, and solving weight loss resistance. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,While I have certain guidelines I follow depending on the patient's conditions that I have seen work very well, all interventions are customized to the patient's preferences, goals, biochemistry, and stage of readiness. I believe the best way to solve problems in the long-term is to listen intently and empower with education. I use questionnaires, laboratory testing, and listening to my clients’ stories to reveal their underlying dysfunctions, then use coaching, education, and evidence-based treatment plans to correct the imbalances and allow the body to thrive. ,

                  ,Information for Patients,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Slower Medicine is a Direct Primary Care Internal Medicine practice, offering full-spectrum functional and holistic medical care for adults at a very affordable monthly price -- without insurance. Your monthly cost is your age (minimum of $25, maximum of $75).  The practice is a low-stress environment where patients can come to get answers and help with many medical issues, be they new or chronic. Longer visits are the norm (commonly 90 minutes or longer), and you may contact me after hours via phone or email.  I enjoy finding and fixing root causes of chronic diseases, with a  strong emphasis on prevention, collaboration and patient education. Questions / inquiries welcome, and initial consults are no-obligation.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients should expect to be treated with respect and dignity. I do not pretend to know everything there is to be known in either conventional or functional medicine, but I am intellectually curious and enjoy learning and teaching my patients about what is going on in their bodies. Although I am very open-minded and flexible in most regards, I am nonetheless quite cautious about prescribing most controlled substances as I believe they generally do more harm than good. I do operate a separate Suboxone clinic for those struggling with opiate addiction, but do not otherwise prescribe chronic opiate pain medications for non-cancer pain. ,

                    ,My current practice includes traditional psychiatric treatment as well as lifestyle optimization to address your concerns. I have a keen interest in nutrition and optimizing this through diet, and have trained in whole food, plant based nutrition as well as paleo diets. At this time, my practice is focused on treating women and girls age 10-64. When you schedule, our intake team will guide you to my portal for submitting intake paperwork, requested at least 1 week prior to your appointment, so it can be fully reviewed prior to your appointment. I may also call you at the time of scheduling to discuss your specific goals, as I am currently in functional medicine training, and would like to know that your goals and my experience line up. ,

                    ,PerrinMD is a medical practice focused on providing progressive, patient-centered health and wellness care to our clients. Using science-based diagnostic testing to identify the root cause of illness and ill-being, our passion and goal is to educate and empower patients to transform their health and lives. When we engage in healthy lifestyle choices we turn off the accelerated aging signals and turn on healthy signals that reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and degeneration. Optimizing hormones and nutrition can maximize healthy lifestyle changes resulting in synergistic health outcomes.,
,
We specialize in bio-identical hormones for men and women, weight loss, auto-immune disease, chronic infections and IV nutrients. ,

                    ,After 17+ years working in a traditional family medicine setting, Dr. Kristie Gering opened Spero Wellness Clinic in January 2017. Spero is a small, direct-pay, functional medicine and primary care clinic.  We utilize the functional medicine philosophy of searching for and attempting to correct root cause, rather than simple symptom management using drugs.  The functional treatment approach ideally utilizes food & lifestyle first, then herbs, supplements and other modalities second, and then medications if/when needed. We believe that healthcare is that it is best approached as a partnership between patient and health care team, and our goal is to impart a life-long learning process rather than a one time quick fix.,

                    ,Caring for patients is my mission. I use very gentle chiropractic adjusting with a method called Directional Non Force Technique. I began DNFT in 1989. In addition to DNFT, I use functional medicine to lead people to optimum health via maximizing their sleep hygiene, enhancing their healthful movement (exercise), eating in ways that support their goals of performing their best and feeling their best mood. I was a chemistry major before I went to chiropractic college. Functional medicine's review of the biochemical pathways that affect your ability to perform, ability to feel contented and deal with complex chronic situations as compared to your personal genome is the part of the picture that brings the toughest cases improvement.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Unconditional positive regard is what you can expect from our visit together. I will make many suggestions, knowing that it can be overwhelming to make many changes at once. YOU will pick which, if any of the suggestions you are now ready to undertake. You will set the pace for the recovery. We'll talk about transforming stress. We'll talk about sleeping your best. We'll talk about  moving your  body enough to stimulate mood and immunity, without wearing you out. We will analyze your genes with 23 and Me to see which genetic propensities you have to need more vitamins, minerals and enzymes. I use kinesiology to fine tune which supplements are best for you, and in what amounts. Charges are $100/hour of the doctor's time.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Our primary goal at Wiseman Family Practice is to provide health education in order to prevent disease. We believe the core problem with many of today's health issues lies in inflammation caused by poor nutrition, stress, and toxins the body accumulates from unhealthy food, water, the environment, and other lifestyle choices. We seek to address these problems so the body can function and heal optimally.  ,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,When treating patients, our objective is to treat the whole person and to understand the root cause of disease. We always use lifestyle modifications or natural, more holistic therapies before using conventional pharmaceuticals, though we do use them when needed depending on individual patient need.   Patients can expect a collaborative approach to address the root cause of any health issues as well as to maintain optimal health.  ,

                    ,Here at Sophia Medical Associates we believe that a healthy body is evidence of a healthy life. We know that it is our responsibility to help each of our patients to achieve that goal. That’s why we practice integrated functional medicine which combines the best attributes of both Western and Eastern medicine for maximum effectiveness.  There are many reasons why we are different from other doctors.  Our approach is a preventative but comprehensive one! Eastern practices teach us the benefits and strategies of natural health solutions, while Western medicine gives us amazing technology to assess potential risks at their root cause, years before they become acute!,

                    ,I am so excited to be a part of medicine at a time when there is so much hope for people dealing with concerns about brain health!  Following the work of thought leaders such as Dr Dale Bredesen, Dr Terry Wahls, and Dr Datis Kharrazian- I hope to help patients and families discover the root cause of their brain based symptoms; and then assist them to develop a plan to achieve improved health.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,When working with a functional medicine approach, it is important for patients to recognize that we are in a discovery process.  This process includes a deep look into their medical history, and a very thorough conversation about their current state of health.  Since we consider the whole person- we want to look at how your life story has led to your current experience.   Be prepared that the first visit is often lengthy, but provides many clues for the next steps.  ,
,
Using these clues, we will use laboratory findings to further identify root cause of symptoms and partner together to create a personalized plan for improved health.  It is not a ""quick fix"" process, but instead a thoughtful and precise look into what creates health for you!,

                    ,After experiencing my own battle with Hypothyroidism and Adrenal Fatigue following the birth of my second child, I  began searching for answers as to why I had suddenly become so sick.

                    ,Associated Family Physicians is a group Family Practice affiliated with Hills Physicians. Dr. Rasnow-Hill is currently the only provider in that group doing functional and integrative medicine.  She also does medical acupuncture and full spectrum Obstetrics. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Even though the group takes insurance, one must expect some out of pocket costs when adopting a functional medicine approach to your health.  Many tests and most supplements are not covered by insurance. Additionally,  the in-depth history and symptom assessment that is crucial to determining areas of focus will take place over the course of multiple office visits (with requisite co-pays) instead of within a single consultation. ,

                    ,Trained in Family Medicine, worked in EM for 20 years.  With recognition that current traditional medicine wasn't truly ""healing"" patients, started exploring other avenues to serve my patients.  Underwent massage therapy training, 200 hour YTT, Perfect Health Certification, Ayurveda Wellness Counselor training (completed) and Ayurveda Wellness Practitioner training (currently), enrolled in  IFM certification program, and am currently taking a functional nutrition certification course.  Utilizing the wisdom of ancient healing systems with the modern science to treat the entire patient...mind, body, and spirit.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Will work together in partnership with the patient, meeting them where they are, providing them with the knowledge and insight to make informed and conscious decisions about how to best impact their health.  Will require that patient has a relationship with a primary care provider for the day to day things or the emergency situations requiring inpatient treatments.  Our time and energy will be devoted to understanding the root cause of any signs and symptoms they may be experiencing and undergoing a more individually based, gradual, but more sustainable return to a healthy balance.  It will require time and effort on both our parts.  ,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,Since graduating residency in 2002, I have been practicing Obstetrics and Gynecology in the traditional medical model. Over time, I have developed an interest in optimizing health in women. While the traditional medical model has made great strides in acute care, it is lacking success in treating chronic issues that many women deal with on a daily basis. This has led me to Functional Medicine, and using a systems biology approach to look for the root cause of these conditions to truly maximize an individual's potential for wellness.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,A patient who is choosing a Functional Medicine approach to health needs to be ready to did deeper into the conditions that are currently being expressed, and be ready to take a collaborative approach to wellness. This requires an open mind, a willingness to change, and the patience to let healing occur.,

                    ,A Healthy State of Mind provides holistic medical care for those suffering from stress, trauma and chronic illness. Chronic stress and past traumas can wreak havoc on the mind and body. The work that I do seeks to help one to heal from these challenges and to gain tools to work with stress and emotional issues that may be at the root of, or result from, stress and trauma. An important part of this work is to also address the physical health issues that may result from long-standing stress and trauma. I use a combination of modalities as part of a functional approach to optimizing health (homeopathy, nutrition and dietary supplements, herbal medicine and mind-body medicine) and welcome anyone seeking greater health and consciousness.,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,My top priority is to give my patients the time and attention they deserve. I created my practice to help patients who are frustrated with mainstream healthcare that treats the body and mind like separate, disconnected parts. Patients who work with me enroll in a series of visits (a program) that is typically about 6 months in duration as I have found that this is the time needed to make significant shifts in one’s health and to lay the groundwork for maintaining the benefits of these shifts over time.

                    ,I am board certified in Internal Medicine and Rheumatology. I primarily practice rheumatology.  Functional Medicine has offered a refreshing and exciting additional approach to helping my patients achieve wellness.   I work with each patient to explore the root cause of illness in his or her individual case.  Together, we explore how nutrition, sleep, stress management, exercise, and mindfulness can be used to improve one's health.   In addition to using traditional and necessary medications to treat autoimmune disease, I explore with each patient how we can incorporate functional medicine in his or her journey to wellness.  This comprehensive approach guides us to better health while living with a chronic autoimmune disease.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I primarily practice rheumatology and treat patients who have suspected or established autoimmune disease.  Patients will need a referral to see me.  Once established, we will explore together whether a functional medicine approach is of interest to the patient.  It will take some time and additional visits to fully explore and establish this plan.  Patients should know that I do not abandon traditional medications or recommendations for treatment of autoimmune disease.  My approach is comprehensive, including traditional medications, while exploring the role that nutrition, exercise, sleep, mindfulness practice, and stress management all play in the path to wellness.,

                    ,I have a small outpatient clinic in a large Level 1 trauma center.  I have a unique ""niche"" in which I attempt to combine my knowledge of nutrition, my knowledge of disease with functional medicine and health.  I also practice palliative care when appropriate.,
I also work in a restorative medicine practice in which I do bio-identical hormones, thyroid, O and P shots and other reproductive medicine needs along with functional medicine at The Albano Clinic.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I do a combination of oral diets, medical therapy, hormone replacement when warranted, lifestyle management and artificial nutrition support when necessary.  My goal to to restore functional health as much as possible, my expectation is ""patient-centered"" care in which you (as the patient) are willing to do your part in bringing forth restorative health once you have the tools necessary to do so.,

                    ,We offer one on one personalized care for each and every patient with the doctor on EACH visit.

One can expect to personally see and converse with Dr. Badanek on each and every visit and the typical visit time frame will last from 30-90 or more if need be per visit.  On office wants to build faith and trust with our patients which then in turn produces compliance when addressing the health challenges presented.  Our office wants to treat you the patient with the same care and respect that we would want.   ,

                    ,We believe that the body is designed to heal and that disease occurs as a result of internal and external toxins impairing the healing process.  Our approach to disease focuses on the biochemical uniqueness of the individual as well as the search for the root cause of illness, rather than just the treatment of symptoms.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Every detail of our practice is designed to calm anxiety and restore hope. The time you spend in our office may not be like your typical experience with conventional medical practice. ,
,
During the medical history and examination, each of our providers works hard to make you feel comfortable and listens intently to what you have to say. They give you ample time to share your concerns, talk about your symptoms, and relay your hopes and fears. When your time together is complete, you will have a treatment plan that is specifically for you.,
,
When you leave, we want you to feel better than you did when you arrived and know that you made the right choice. Above all, we want you to leave with hope that your health and your life can be better.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,FoundationMED is a consultative Functional Medicine practice founded by Michael Citron, MD.  Functional Medicine focuses on understanding and addressing the fundamental physiological processes, the environmental inputs, and the genetic predispositions that influence health and disease - so that interventions are focused on treating the cause of the problem, not just masking the symptoms. We are wide in scope, and address issues involving gut, thyroid, adrenal, hormones (including BHRT), methylation, aging, energy and much more. ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,To be able to better serve you, we need to understand your personal situation (and not put you into a preconceived ""box"" based on checklists or pre-made protocols). Thus, our initial visit is almost 2 hr, including direct MD consultation (90min) and Health Coach consultation (15-20min). ,
,
PRIOR to your initial visit, we request completion of targeted questionnaires. ,
,
We work together to develop a plan action customized for you. You will receive a VERY extensive written ""Encounter Note"" outlining findings and the plan of action for each visit. You also receive multiple PDFs with appropriate information based your individual needs, as well as an overview Care Plan note. ,
,
Finally, each visit includes InBody evaluation at no charge. ,

                    ,Hello,
I am a Board Certified Family physician as well as Fellowship trained in Integrative Medicine through the University of Arizona. I am passionate about Functional and Integrative Medicine and am especially interested in reversing chronic diseases such as Alzheimers Disease and Cardiovascular Disease. I have completed extra training through IFM on cognitive decline and the Bredesen ReCode protocol. I am in the process of transitioning from a traditional medical practice to a Functional/Integrative practice. I see patient's on Saturday's while this transition is occurring. Please use the phone number listed above to set up an appointment or e mail me.,
Best Wishes!,
Dr Zielinski,

                    ,Hey there, I’m Dr. Michelle – SO glad you found me!,
 ,
Most days, you can find me hanging out in my mid-century modern-inspired home office. I’m a comfy-pants-wearing functional medicine maven who loves nerding out on herbal remedies… healing foods… and all things hormone-related.,
That’s right, I run my virtual practice from home, and I must say that it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I get to sip on oolong tea (or butter coffee) and help women reconnect with their body, their mind, and their purpose. My goal is to help guide them towards becoming their best self – radiant, fulfilled, and focused.,
 ,
Through helping women reclaim their health, I’m also challenging the current medical paradigm. One where YOU’RE in charge.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,One of my goals when working with you is to flip the “scrip” on your idea of wellness. You’re here because you believe that you can feel better – and I agree with you 100%! BUT I’m going to give it to you straight – you’re going to have to do some work. The good news is that Corrine and I will be here to support and guide you the whole way. Remember, an estimated 80% of your success is based on YOUR actions – I’m not here to give you a magic pill to fix you. You can fix yourself, and I’ll teach you how! I call this Health-Empowerment. You’ll gain a wealth of knowledge that will benefit you and your family for a lifetime.,

                    ,Precision Pain Consultants is focused on the diagnosis/treatment of spinal conditions, sports injuries, peripheral musculoskeletal disorders, and migraine.  We specialize in regenerative treatments such as prolotherapy and neural prolotherapy, platelet rich plasma, bone marrow and adipose-derived regenerative (stem) cells, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and amniotic fluid derived growth factors. We use Botox and peripheral nerve stimulation for migraine.,
We also adopt a functional medicine approach to chronic pain conditions in conjunctions with other treatments.  We offer nutritional consults and full advanced lab blood/urine/saliva/stool testing and interpretation.  We also offer acupuncture and esthetic regenerative procedures.,

We focus initially on diagnosing the source of pain, and treat them, as such as possible, with a combination of regenerative treatments and lifestyle changes.,
We try to stay away from chronic opioid treatments and repeated corticosteroid injections.  We also advocate for non-surgical solutions to these problems.,

                    ,At Anchor Wellness Center, we practice a new model of medicine known as root cause medicine or Functional Medicine. It incorporates the best diagnostic tools and technologies from conventional medicine, as well as emerging tests and tools that help us identify the critical imbalances that are at the root of all illness. We practice patient-centered, not disease-centered, medicine. With our team of doctors, nutritionists, and fitness professionals to guide you through this journey, a healthier you is right around the corner! We will help you restore, protect and grow your health throughout your lifetime,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,To start, you will fill out your LivingMatrix Functional Medicine history and timeline which helps put your symptoms, diagnoses and health concerns into the functional medicine timeline. From this information, we glean key insights into the possible triggering events and other issues that may be contributing to your health concerns. You can expect a 1.5-hour first appointment with me to go through your history, create our course of action and determine next steps and testing. At the end of this appointment, you will have key actions to start on immediately. Then once tests are back we then create your plan for your program based on the lab results and health,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I have been practicing integrative medicine for over 20 years now, the last 18 in private practice in Colorado. I am Board Certified in Internal Medicine since 1997, Holistic Medicine in 2000 and Integrative Medicine in 2015. I began my functional medicine education in 1996 and a 2 yr fellowship in Integrative Medicine at Univ. of AZ with Dr. Weil in 2000. My practice centers around a holistic/functional/integrative approach to most medical concerns that patients have. I believe in the body's natural ability to heal itself once obstacles to healing have been removed and deficiencies/imbalances have been corrected. Health and disease result from a constellation of issues that require a multidisciplinary approach.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients can expect an hour long appointment with an expert physician in integrative/functional medicine who is Board Certified in Internal Medicine and Integrative Medicine. They can expect to be listened to, heard, examined, evaluated and offered a diagnostic protocol and treatment plan. They can expect their issues to be thoroughly investigated and be educated about all their options. I prefer the most effective, least invasive diagnostic and treatment protocols. Although cures may be in the hands of higher powers, I am typically able to offer improvement and insight.,

                    ,Heart Health Clinic is a practice dedicated to making sure our patients aren’t just another statistic. We’ve combined the best of traditional cardiology methods with the most effective holistic approach to prevention in order to improve each patient’s overall health and stop heart problems in their tracks.,
,
Over 50% of heart attacks occur in people that have “normal” levels of cholesterol. Heart Health Clinic was created to look at the root cause of disease and put a stop to it.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We spend extensive amounts of time with each patient to discuss the best method for prevention and disease reversal. We answer all of your questions and explain to you the meaning behind each test, every result and every treatment plan. At Heart Health Clinic, we do the following:,
	•	Work towards developing a trusting partnership,
	•	Suggest natural products  that lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and stress,
	•	Offer more practical advice for prevention over and above “diet and exercise.”,
	•	Treatment plans designed to get you OFF of prescription medication,
	•	Tailor a medication and supplement regimen unique to your genetics and environment,

                    ,Your body doesn?t choose to be less efficient or less functional without good cause - and often multiple causes!  We look at likely contributors, and how to provide the support your system needs to restore natural balance. Then your symptoms not only resolve, but are less likely to re-occur.What may seem dysfunctional in your body is actually its best adaptive choice - with its current resources. We look at how to increase its options - by increasing its energetic or nutritional resources, by activating your suppressed  functions, or by removing barriers.,

                    ,I do my best to live by Hippocrates statement, ""Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food"". As a compounding pharmacist at Fallon Wellness Pharmacy, I try to help patients improve their health through lifestyle modifications including nutrition and exercise along with supplementation as necessary.  It may seem ironic, but as a pharmacist my goal is to help patients minimize their prescription medications which is why I sometimes refer to myself as ""the anti-pharmacist"". ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Functional Medicine requires getting to know the patient as a whole person, including your current symptoms and why you are seeking a consultation, but also your family history and how you got to the place you are today. This will require intake forms which are quite detailed to be filled out, and a treatment plan will be created which will likely focus on diet, exercise, sleep, stress and other lifestyle modifications. We will work together to devise the plan, and I will help throughout your journey to get you to the place you want to be.,

All Services are customized to fit the needs of each patient and can be discussed at your initial appointment. Call us today for a complimentary consultation.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,After many years of practicing Internal Medicine and seeing patients improve briefly but in time develop more diagnoses, my strong sense that I was not doing all I could to help my patients heal and lead vibrant lives brought me to Functional Medicine. I now dedicate my practice fully to Functional Medicine Consultations and am passionate about getting to the root cause of symptoms and dis-ease. I work in partnership with each patient and use the best available testing to help us identify areas that need support. I develop an individualized treatment plan for each patient to help them heal while we watch their symptoms improve and often disappear.  My extensive Internal Medicine experience allows me to integrate the best of both worlds.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,My initial consultation lasts between 60-90 minutes. A very detailed and complete past medical, surgical, social, family and nutritional history is obtained. An initial impression and treatment plan is developed and testing is ordered. The testing is quite comprehensive and usually involves blood, stool, urine and often saliva samples. The first and second follow up visits are scheduled for 2 and 6 weeks later. They last 45-60 minutes and your response to the initial plan, new test results, and further recommendations are discussed. You will be educated and empowered to make decisions that support your health. Subsequent visits tend to be shorter and spread out by 3 months but are determined based on each patient's needs.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,My approach to health is based in the understanding that the human body is beautifully resilient. Disease is more of an alert or warning sign that something is going wrong in the body and needs to be corrected.  By only suppressing the symptoms with medications we lose the opportunity to listen to the body's signaling and make adjustments.If we give the body what it needs i.e.: feed it, water it, move it, relax it, rest it and nourish it - ""diseases"" can improve or resolve because you corrected the underlying dysfunction.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We are seeking patients who are dealing with a chronic medical issue or just feeling less then their best and not getting results using a conventional medicine approach.  Before your visit I work with you to collect a comprehensive history. When I see you in the office we review your history, I perform a full physical exam, and based on the information collected I recommend necessary lab testing.  Together we will work to identify your key health goals.  At the end of your first visit you will be emailed a treatment plan with targeted therapies and individualized lifestyle modifications you can start implementing from day 1.  Your first follow-up visit will involve reviewing any initial lab testing done and further personalizing your treatm,

                    ,We are committed to improving patients’ quality of life not just by treating symptoms, but by addressing root cause of disease.  We believe in obtaining actionable laboratory data that helps provide an appropriate plan, while also enabling prevention and early treatment of disease. Patients do best when they understand what it takes to energize their own healing capacity. ,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We create a personalized plan for each patient that guides them through the appropriate steps to address the root cause of their symptoms. We start with lifestyle -- nutrition, movement, sleep and stress.  Before a patient's first visit, they will complete an extensive questionnaire that gathers information about health history, family history, diet, habits and symptoms. At the first 60 minute visit, we review this questionnaire in detail and determine appropriate lab testing. During the second 60-minute visit we discuss lab results and an initial treatment plan is provided. The third visit is typically 30 minutes and we assess progress and challenges.  This process continues until health goals are reached and maintained.,

                    ,The Marcus Center of Integrative Health is a Thomas Jefferson University based practice in Villanova, PA. It is in a  state of the art facility that blends integrative functional medicine therapies with cutting edge diagnostics (combined PET-MRI imaging, cardiac and pulmonary testing, advanced biometric testing) and cutting edge therapies (such as IV and PO nutrient therapies). Besides offering Functional Medicine evaluations and chronic care management, we also have specialized focused programs for Executive Health, Executive Brain Health, and Genomic Healthy Weight and Lifestyle Management.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I have been practicing Integrative Functional Medicine for over 17 years, so patients should expect to find a partner in optimizing their health. I use a holistic functional medicine evaluation to address a patient's medical concerns, health problems and goals. The approach should help to systematically restore the patient's own innate balance by utilizing nutritional optimization, gut health rebalancing, stress reduction, hormone re-balancing, detoxification and energy enhancing therapies as needed.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I practice a holistic approach to health and wellness, which means that I look at how all areas of your life are connected. Does stress at your job or in your relationship cause you to overeat? Does lack of sleep or low energy prevent you from exercising? As we work together, we will look at how all parts of your life affect your health as a whole. My approach with nutrition is not to dwell on calories, carbs, fats, and proteins but to address your bio-individuality; which is the idea that each of us has unique food and lifestyle needs. One person?s food is another person?s poison, and that?s why fad diets tend to fail in the long run. I work to encourage changes based on your unique needs, lifestyle, preferences, and ancestral background.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,A Holistic Health Practitioner and Health Coach is a guide and mentor who empowers you and provides ongoing support and guidance as you set goals and make sustainable changes that improve your health and happiness. ,
,
As your Clinical Nutritionist, Herbalist, and Integrative Health Coach, I will listen carefully and we?ll navigate the world of contradictory nutrition and health advice together to explore what food choices, supplements and herbs will truly work for your unique biological and lifestyle needs.,
,

Create your personal blueprint,
Decipher your body?s unique needs,
Set your personal goals and work towards sustainable change,

                    ,I recently completed the three-year education program with The Institute for Functional Medicine, which is the most comprehensive training available in this field.   My vision is to create a multi-disciplinary team of Functional Medicine Practitioners, Nutritionists, and Health Coaches to educate, empower and support you.

                    ,Together we complete a lifestyle assessment that looks at foundational factors such as sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress levels, relationships, and genetics.  We also review your comprehensive health history, past lab results, and symptoms.  Following this assessment, I will likely recommend new lab tests to gather more data.   The detailed analysis of these findings will help me pinpoint the underlying root cause of your symptoms and create a personalized treatment plan to help you reclaim your health. Patients should expect to complete several visits including initial consultation, lab tests, a case review, and 3-6 follow up visits on their healing journey.,

In this type of treatment, our providers establish a partnership with our patients to achieve their health goals. We spend time discussing personal and medical histories, as well as lifestyle and environmental factors in order to determine the cause of the conditions and diseases our patients experience.,

We will explore how your lifestyle, environmental exposures, and genetics contribute to your condition. I use state of-the-art laboratory testing to identify the underlying triggers and develop individualized treatment protocols to resolve symptoms and reverse disease. I integrate nutritional and botanical medicine with bio-identical hormone replacement therapy, and use acupuncture and Chinese herbs as foundational therapies to reduce pain, restore balance, and promote optimal health.,

We will review any lab work you have, determine what else might be needed to identify the underlying causes of your condition, and a preliminary treatment protocol established. Once results are back, we will develop an effective integrated treatment plan.,

                    ,At Resolve Medical, we help your family achieve wellness and health by utilizing proven holistic healing techniques to address the root causes of disease and dysfunction. We always strive to treat first with personalized, evidence-based nutritional and life-style programs. We also integrate physician-grade nutraceuticals when appropriate, and reserve pharmaceutical medications as a last resort. The approach we take of combining Direct Primary Care with Functional Medicine is what sets Resolve Medical apart as a leader in the health care community.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,In Functional Medicine we seek to discover and treat the root causes of conditions. As such, it is time intensive. Prior to the first visit you will be sent extensive questionnaires to fill out on your personal online patient portal. Expect the first visit with the physician to take 90 minutes for in-depth discussion and exam. Labs will be ordered at the first visit, and discussed 1-2 weeks later at the follow up visit, at which time a personalized care plan is created for you.,

                    ,Dr. Edgerton is a board certified OB/GYN. His interest in bioidentical hormone replacement started years ago when he realized many of his patients were not improving with some of the standard medical regimens.  Research and study led him to understand that there is a wealth of scientific literature to support supplementation with more natural forms of many medicines.  He now feels he can best help his patients and add life to years as well as years to life.He received his medical degree from Louisiana State University and completed his training at the University of Texas in Houston.  Dr. Edgerton and his family have lived in the Austin area since 2005. His outside interests include sports, exercise, family, friends and nature.,

                    ,Based on the desire to integrate natural, alternative and conventional therapies, the Indigo Integrative Health Clinic (IIHC) was founded in February 2011 at the Waterfront Center in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. IIHC specializes in balancing the immune system, which is integral to all matters pertaining to health and disease.,
,
Treatments are targeted to address both the root cause of the disease and the immune dysfunction that allows the disease to persist. Correcting this dysfunction and immune deficiency is vital to successful treatment therapies.

                    ,For your initial comprehensive patient visit, please allow 90 minutes for a complete assessment of your health and history. Lab tests are often performed on the first day to establish a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. If you take supplements, please bring them or a list of the brand and ingredients. If you have had any relevant tests done, such as blood tests, MRIs or X-rays, arrange to bring copies of the reports with you.,

                    ,Our functional medicine practice began as a labor of love after I had a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction and was no longer able to practice in my field of Radiology. I searched for a way to regain my own health and discovered the importance of ""root cause"" medicine. Functional Medicine allows us to look at the whole person and not just focus on the symptoms. By scientifically assessing and carefully addressing the root cause of your chronic health concern, we can help you find the way to optimal health.,

I am not content to ""medicate ""a disease or mask symptoms until I I have exhausted every preventative approach.Illness is caused by too much of something bad or not enough of something good. I first identify triggers that are causing inflammation.  I correct micro nutritional imbalances. I implement a personalized oligo antigenic diet. I carefully test for triggers. I do personalized medicine- in other words - every aspect of their health - their energy, skin, mood, sleep, weight.  Every patient is unique , so every treatment plan is as well.I won't stop until you are better!!Once you are better, I will use a personalized medicine approach to ,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I continue to offer massage therapy and myofascial services at my Williamsburg, Virginia private practice. I hope to complete my Functional Medicine (through IFM) and Herbal Medicine (through David Winston) programs in Fall 2018. I have started offering a few interested clients functional/holisitic/herbal health consultations as I finish my training. I also work in a local Urgent Care practice as a Nurse Practitioner and occasionally do massage at the Spa of Colonial Williamsburg.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Please feel free to make an appointment for massage or myofasical services through the scheduling page on my website. If you are interested in a functional/holisitic/herbal health consultation please email me. With these clients I apply all the threads of my background and what I am currently learning. Some clients have agreed to let me confidentially document our collaborative healthcare journey for case studies I need in my programs. This may be a good option for persons without insurance or other options for holistic care. Both online and in person consultations are possible. ,

                    ,Since 2003, Functional Medicine & Integrative Care has been helping people reclaim their health and vitality by treating the root causes of chronic illness. My approach starts with a comprehensive assessment of a person' entire health story, their goals and concerns and previous medical and lab records. This initial consultation can be in the CT office or using telemedicine. My focus is on using the safest most effective treatments possible to restore balance and support detox pathways, using diet and micronutrition to heal the gut and feed every cell. I may also use prescription medications if needed, such as LDN, bio identical hormones, medical cannabis, FSM, and more.  please visit my website for more detailed information.,

We provide compassionate, personalized healthcare in an unhurried, non-institutionalized setting.  Dr. Tanya B. Teggatz is board-certified in family medicine and integrative medicine.

                    ,We offer a free 15 minute consult to see if functional medicine and/or medical acupuncture is right for you.  Your first scheduled visit usually lasts about an hour in which Dr. Teggatz takes a very detailed history and performs a physical exam.  Based on these findings and any previous medical records provided, lab testing is usually ordered.  The second visit involves going over these tests and making a detailed treatment plan which usually involves diet, movement, improving sleep and relationships, stress management and the use of supplements and occasionally medications.  Dr. Teggatz also works closely with a health coach who  provides further instruction, accountability and inspiration.  Acupuncture is an optional, beneficial service.,

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I have been in the field of Family Practice since 1995.  I became increasingly frustrated with my inability to make significant improvements in a patient's health.  I was treating their symptoms, but unable to see a real change in their outcomes.  I began to use all my resources to gain knowledge about what  the underlying causes of their symptoms and disease could be.  In doing this I began to see how stress, environment, nutrition, activity level and lifestyle choices were things I could change and as a result see change in labs and ultimately outcomes.  I chose to make Functional Medicine the focus of my practice.  My practice focuses on the patient and all that relates to the patient.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Patients should expect to be treated as a whole person.  They can expect to get an education about their health and life that will enable them to make changes to improve longevity.  I run extensive lab panels to determine not only your current level of inflammation, stress and disease, but also predict future disease risk.  Together, we will come up with a comprehensive plan to improve you health and happiness.,

                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I am in the process of certification in Functional Medicine but already have incorporated many of the techniques and principles  of functional medicine into my traditional internal medicine practice ( planned completion early 2019).  I look forward to moving thru my certification process and bringing this new training to fruition within my clinics.,

Each one of us at Incredible Health has had our own health crisis. We have been patients with our appropriate ""billing codes"". We are driven to get ourselves and our clients as healthy as possible.

You know more can be done for your health. We can help!,

                    ,We help our clients to achieve and then sustain recovery from chronic disease and inflammatory states.  We use functional medicine knowledge to help each unique person discover the true root causes of dysfunction and dis-ease in their unique body.  Then we use powerful coaching and an ongoing partnership with each client to educate, inspire, and empower them to change their lives and find true wellness.  Finally!   ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,We have worked successfully with clients struggling with a wide variety of chronic inflammatory conditions and diseases.  Typically with multiple diagnoses.  We often work with those who have already visited one or more functional medicine practices.  These clients received an expensive, likely quite accurate ""data dump"" of functional medicine insight.   However, without ongoing partnership, coaching, and regular guidance to implement the FM wisdom, these clients weren't able to maximize the value of their investment and make the progressive lifestyle change that would actually bring them wellness.  Functional medicine knowledge only matters when it is used in a way that helps people to truly get well.  That's our passion.  ,

,
 I have found, since beginning to practice healthcare in 2004, that the most effective way to heal & maintain wellness is to address all aspects of self- body, mind, & spirit. I offer Functional Medicine & Shamanic Healing to support healing from the inside out.  Together we put on our detective hats and unravel the clues to your health. We start by taking ample time to discuss your history.  Many answers are right there. Next we discuss testing & then treatment options- which are holistic & may include: diet, lifestyle, mindfulness, movement, supplements & Rx's. We continue working together until the healing is complete.  ,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,I welcome you to be fully engaged in your healing & wellness, & I will do the same. The first appointment together is 1 hour so that I fully get to know you, & understand the causes and effects of what has contributed to your current state of health. Follow up appointments are 30-60 minutes, depending on your unique care.  Treatment plans are highly individualized & may involve bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, or bi-annual appointments. My goal is to develop a plan together that is sustainable, measurable, effective, well tolerated, & fully supported by you. I accept United Healthcare Commercial & Tricare, & Rocky Mountain insurance. Most clients are private/cash pay & may use HSA/FSA. Long distance is an option, depending on the needs. ,

My definition of wellness emphasizes the broader concepts of health promotion and preventative care. I believe, “…Health is a state of complete physical, social, and mental well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (World Health Organization). I recognize for those who truly value their health, having a physician as their advocate is the ideal doctor-patient relationship. As my patient, you will receive an expanded annual Comprehensive Wellness Evaluation, which will be the cornerstone of your personalized wellness plan, created to keep you feeling your best.,

                    ,My office is uniquely personal -- you'll be able to reach me directly because I believe that a caring therapeutic relationship is at the heart of the healing process.

It comes from within, which means you'll need to be actively engaged in the process and willing to make changes in your life in order to see changes in your health. Most of my patients are highly motivated to do what it takes to feel better, they just need some guidance on their path to wellness.

                                      ,About My Practice,
                    ,I help patients achieve optimal health and wellness through a compassionate individualized medical approach. I focus on making home visits and spending time getting to know patients and their unique circumstances. I want patients to know that I will take care of them and listen to their concerns. I have taken into consideration most of the things patients don't like about seeing a traditional doctor. I go back to a more old-fashioned notion of what your doctor should and can be. By getting to know you well and getting an in depth assessment of your life, I hope to get patients off medications and not be too quick to start them on medications. I use diet and lifestyle, along with targeted supplements to make that happen.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Initial consultation will be 2 hours and follow ups will be 45-60 minutes. I work with nutritionists and health coaches to coordinate some of your follow up care. This team approach maximized outcomes and helps patients implement our health plan. I also offer in-home phlebotomy services at no charge to you.,

                    ,I have over 30 years experience in medicine and holistic medicine for the past 17 years.  I love working with people to assist them in experiencing a healthy life.  I spend 2 hours with each new patient getting to understand all the events that have impacted their life.  I study and research to create a healing plan with total patient participation.,
Dr. Joan Sloss, my healthcare partner, specializes in manual therapy, craniosacral therapy and orthopedic massage.,
At Healing Unleashed we offer a state-of-the-art Neurofeedback program that includes low energy stimulation along with neurofeedback training.  We can achieve greater results, safely, effectively and in less time than more traditional neurofeedback.,
                  
                                      ,What Patients Can Expect,
                    ,Your health is your primary responsibility.  My role is teacher, coach, and facilitator of your healing path.  You can expect my full attention when you are relating your life story.  I care deeply about all my patients, and you will be able to feel safe and heard.,
“Healing Unleashed is the long-held vision I have had about how medicine should be practiced. As a medical doctor, my highest calling is to help people achieve good health with holistic, safe and effective medicine in a loving, caring supportive environment.”,
